{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "For Stephen A. Feinberg, the long road back from the most disastrous investment of his career \u00d1 Chrysler L.L.C. \u00d1 began last week around a polished wood table inside the Treasury Department.\n\nIt was not the road he had envisioned when his private investment firm, Cerberus Capital Management, bought Chrysler in the summer of 2007.\n\nBack then, Mr. Feinberg was hailed as a hero \u00d1 the Wall Street financier who just might save the American car industry. Instead, he lost billions for his investors and co-investors. And last week it became clear that he would lose Chrysler\u00d5s auto operations, as well.\n\nSo as the Obama administration prepared to assert control over Chrysler and General Motors, Mr. Feinberg flew to Washington to try to salvage what he could. In a midweek meeting with Treasury officials, Mr. Feinberg agreed to give up the 80.1 percent stake in Chrysler held by Cerberus and its co-investors, according to a person briefed on the negotiations. He first offered to do this last year.\n\nBut Mr. Feinberg did not go quietly. He also discussed additional federal money to help his other wayward investments in Detroit: GMAC and Chrysler Financial. Cerberus is now pushing the government to help orchestrate a merger of the two auto financing companies \u00d1 a move that might eventually yield a profit for Cerberus.\n\nWhether the Obama administration will oblige is unclear. But this much is certain: Cerberus, long considered one of the most formidable investment firms on Wall Street and in Washington, stumbled badly in Detroit. It is now struggling to rescue not only what it can of its investments \u00d1 about $3 billion in Chrysler and the two finance companies \u00d1 but also its reputation. Cerberus persuaded others on Wall Street to invest billions more.\n\nCerberus, many agree, was like so many private equity firms that overreached during the late boom in corporate buyouts. But the firm also seems to have miscalculated in Washington. Mr. Feinberg employs a Who\u00d5s Who of Washington insiders, among them John W. Snow, the former Treasury secretary, and Dan Quayle, a former vice president. Cerberus has lobbied aggressively in recent months to shape the government\u00d5s rescue of the auto industry, to little avail.\n\n\u00d2There was a certain degree of hubris here,\u00d3 said John Gabbert, the chief executive of PitchBook, a firm that researches private equity.\n\nIts daring deal for Chrysler vaulted Cerberus, then virtually unknown outside financial circles, to prominence. But now Cerberus \u00d1 and its investors \u00d1 are paying the price.\n\nCerberus persuaded some of the most prominent names in the financial world to join it in its Chrysler and GMAC investments. Its co-investors in those include the investment arm of Abu Dhabi as well as hedge funds like York Capital. Some hedge funds, like Eton Park, invested only in GMAC, but they, too, are feeling the pain.\n\nThose co-investors have taken four times the losses in aggregate as Cerberus, and many have already written their stakes down to zero, or pennies on the dollar. A few of them, though, doubled down on GMAC in December, counting on Cerberus to find a way out of the wreck.\n\nA former trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert the junk bond powerhouse of the 1980s, Mr. Feinberg rose from relative obscurity on Wall Street after a decade trading mostly in bonds.\n\nBut Cerberus, like many private equity firms, loaded its new ward with what turned out to be crippling amounts of debt. Cerberus piled about $20 billion of debt onto Chrysler, Mr. Gabbert said. As car sales plunged across the industry \u00d1 and, in particular, at Chrysler \u00d1 the carmaker began to buckle under its load.\n\n\u00d2It seems like Chrysler would be in extreme difficulty whether Cerberus had showed up or not,\u00d3 said Josh Lerner, a professor at the Harvard Business School who has studied private equity.\n\nA few weeks ago, Cerberus began telling its co-investors that it was likely to give up control of Chrysler\u00d5s auto unit, according to a co-investor and also the person briefed on Mr. Feinberg\u00d5s meeting. The co-investors had agreed from the start that Cerberus could give away their stakes along with its own and that Cerberus could make virtually all of the decisions related to Chrysler and GMAC.\n\nCerberus put in only about one-fifth of the capital for Chrysler and GMAC, limiting its financial downside, but it was in charge of appointing new management teams and establishing Chrysler\u00d5s overall strategy.\n\nCerberus began losing its control over its Detroit investments when the government stepped in to rescue the automakers last year. In the case of GMAC, the government invested money in December and required that most of Cerberus\u00d5s operations team be removed. But some co-investors said that made sense because at that time, the government became the majority owner of GMAC."}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "A longtime director at Bank of America resigned on Friday, the latest in a series of changes on the company\u00d5s board.\n\nO. Temple Sloan, 70, had served on the bank\u00d5s board for 13 years, much of it as the lead director, giving him influence second only to the chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis. In recent months, Mr. Sloan, a strong ally of Mr. Lewis\u00d5s, had become the focus of shareholder complaints over the bank\u00d5s merger with Merrill Lynch.\n\nMr. Sloan lost some of his power after the bank\u00d5s annual meeting last month, when shareholders voted to appoint an independent chairman, stripping Mr. Lewis of that title. The board chose a director other than Mr. Sloan to become chairman. Soon afterward, the new chairman, Walter E. Massey, created a committee to review board activities; Mr. Sloan was not named to the panel.\n\nSome shareholder groups that have been critical of the bank responded favorably to Mr. Sloan\u00d5s resignation.\n\n\u00d2As the lead independent director, he bears primary responsibility for the board\u00d5s failure to independently oversee management,\u00d3 said Michael Garland, a spokesman for the CtW Investment Group, which helps invest union pension funds.\n\nMr. Sloan is the second longtime director to leave. Meredith Spangler, a large shareholder who had been a director for two decades, retired this spring. Both Ms. Spangler and Mr. Sloan were supporters of Mr. Lewis, who said in a statement that he would miss Mr. Sloan.\n\n\u00d2Temple has been a trusted adviser who has made an invaluable contribution to the success of our company,\" Mr. Lewis said.\n\nMore changes could occur. When the government released the bank\u00d5s stress test, Mr. Massey said he was reviewing the makeup of the board to ensure its members had enough financial expertise."}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "The swarm of legal and political troubles that prompted Mr. Lewis to resign from his post atop Bank of America on Wednesday are likely to follow him long after he leaves. Indeed, new ones are already on the way.\n\nAndrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general of New York, is considering charging Mr. Lewis with civil fraud as early as next week on the grounds of failing to disclose crucial information about the bank\u00d5s merger with Merrill Lynch to shareholders, according to a person familiar with Mr. Cuomo\u00d5s plans. The attorney general has been examining why details of Merrill\u00d5s bonuses, losses, write-downs, and the consideration that Bank of America executives gave to canceling the merger at the last minute, were not revealed.\n\nThe inquiry is one of several investigations that are set to intensify in coming weeks over the bank\u00d5s purchase of Merrill Lynch, and the role that Mr. Lewis and other executives played in not disclosing the losses and bonus payouts. The inquiries, which have multiplied as the attorney general of Ohio and several lawmakers sought answers, led Mr. Lewis to a growing recognition that they were becoming an issue for the company, said a person familiar with Mr. Lewis\u00d5s reasoning for retiring.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is also preparing a case that will be tried in federal court in the next few months, claiming that the bank had violated federal securities laws by not informing shareholders of the bonuses paid by Merrill to employees. The action comes after Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the United States District Court in New York rejected what he viewed as a contrived settlement between the two that had allowed Bank of America to avoid naming specific executives and lawyers who knew of the bonuses and were responsible for disclosure decisions.\n\nThe disclosure issue has also become a political lightning rod for Bank of America, which is trying to repay $45 billion in taxpayer support. Lawmakers have been seeking similar information from the bank, and from Mr. Lewis, who has already testified on Capitol Hill about the matter. Leaders of the Congressional committee that is interested in the merger said in interviews that their scrutiny would remain strong after Mr. Lewis left.\n\n\u00d2This matter is not closed \u00d1 the investigation has to continue,\u00d3 said Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio. \u00d2He became the face of a system that was suddenly exposed as not being as adept and forthcoming as people would expect.\u00d3\n\nOn Tuesday, the bank is due to provide a log of documents to Representative Edolphus Towns, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The bank is arguing that it should be allowed to keep those documents confidential.\n\nBank of America will continue to pay Mr. Lewis\u00d5s legal bills after he retires, Robert Stickler, a spokesman, said. Mr. Lewis recently hired a lawyer, Mary Jo White of Debevoise & Plimpton in New York, to handle his case. The bank is using a lawyer at another firm, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton.\n\n\u00d2Our company continues to try to cooperate with the various investigations in a very difficult environment,\u00d3 Mr. Stickler said.\n\nThe bank has said that it did not mislead investors in the disclosure that it made about the merger with Merrill Lynch, and claimed it should not be forced to reveal the legal advice that it received just before shareholders approved the deal on Dec. 5.\n\nAs long as Mr. Lewis is chief executive of the bank, he can influence decisions on what it turns over. But when he departs, his power dims.\n\nCompanies often claim that their legal advice should be kept private. But that privilege applies only to the company that hired the lawyers, not its executives, said Jill E. Fisch, a corporate law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. That means that Mr. Lewis would not be able to block lawyers from revealing information if the bank decided to let them open up.\n\nThe bank\u00d5s board has increased its involvement in the investigations in recent meetings, according to two people briefed on the board\u00d5s thinking. The directors have studied \u00d2what if\u00d3 prospects around each inquiry into the bank and tried to analyze what to do if other investigations emerge later on. One outcome involves charges filed against an executive of the bank, one of these people said.\n\nMr. Lewis is also a member of the board, and he has been present during those discussions.\n\nOn a business tour of Asia in recent weeks, Mr. Lewis spent time thinking about his legacy and discussing it with others, said a person familiar with the matter. The Merrill merger, which seemed ideal until it soured, will probably become his final chapter, Mr. Lewis acknowledged then, the person said.\n\nMr. Lewis leaves before it is clear whether his bet on Merrill and other deals in recent years were worthwhile. Merrill units have been turning profits, but the political and public fallout may not have been worth it, analysts said. And for the hard-charging bank chief, the image of the Wall Street king who reached too far even while taking bailout money will be hard to erase.\n\n\u00d2This man has a major stain on him,\u00d3 said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. \u00d2I\u00d5ve known him for decades, and what was painful is he\u00d5s actually a decent guy.\u00d3\n\nThe challenges come as the bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., strives to assure regulators that it will remain on sound financial footing. The bank is still in the bailout ranks, and it will not be free to pay its workers as it sees fit until it repays at least some of that aid.\n\n\u00d2This is a difficult environment, and I\u00d5d like to see the company move past the investigations,\u00d3 said Jonathan Finger, a bank shareholder who is suing over the merger. \u00d2They\u00d5re a distraction. They hang over the company. The fact that he\u00d5s resigning is an important first step.\u00d3\n\nThis month, Mr. Lewis began telling confidants that he may have lost hope of escaping from the taint of the deal, said two people who have spoken with him.\n\nAnd, they said, he told them that he wanted nothing more than for the bank to move on."}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "The rest of the nation may be getting back to basics, but on Wall Street, paychecks still come with a golden promise.\n\nWorkers at the largest financial institutions are on track to earn as much money this year as they did before the financial crisis began, because of the strong start of the year for bank profits.\n\nEven as the industry\u00d5s compensation has been put in the spotlight for being so high at a time when many banks have received taxpayer help, six of the biggest banks set aside over $36 billion in the first quarter to pay their employees, according to a review of financial statements.\n\nIf that pace continues all year, the money set aside for compensation suggests that workers at many banks will see their pay \u00d1 much of it in bonuses \u00d1 recover from the lows of last year.\n\n\u00d2I just haven\u00d5t seen huge changes in the way people are talking about compensation,\u00d3 said Sandy Gross, managing partner of Pinetum Partners, a financial recruiting firm. \u00d2Wall Street is being realistic. You have to retain your human capital.\u00d3\n\nBrad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, was more critical. \u00d2Like everything on Wall Street, they\u00d5re starting to sin again,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2As you see a recovery, you\u00d5ll see everybody\u00d5s compensation beginning to rise.\u00d3\n\nIn total, the banks are not necessarily spending more on compensation, because their work forces have shrunk sharply in the last 18 months. Still, the average pay for those who remain \u00d1 rank-and-file workers whose earnings are not affected by government-imposed limits \u00d1 appears to be rebounding.\n\nOf the large banks receiving federal help, Goldman Sachs stands out for setting aside the most per person for compensation. The bank, which nearly halved its compensation last year, set aside $4.7 billion for worker pay in the quarter. If that level continues all year, it would add up to average pay of $569,220 per worker \u00d1 almost as much as the pay in 2007, a record year.\n\n\u00d2We need to be able to pay our people,\u00d3 said Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman, adding that the rest of the year might not prove as profitable, and so the first-quarter reserves might simply be \u00d2sensible husbandry.\u00d3\n\nIndeed, last year, when Goldman lost money in the fourth quarter, it did not pay out some of the compensation it had set aside when earnings were stronger.\n\nAt other banks, pay scales tilt in favor of particular units. JPMorgan Chase, for example, is setting aside what would total $138,234 on average for workers. But in the bank\u00d5s trading and investment banking unit, if revenue stays at first-quarter levels, workers are on track to earn an average of $509,524 over the year. That figure was $345,147 in 2006.\n\nTo try to blunt criticism of high pay, some banks have introduced reforms to take back bonuses from individual workers whose bets later lose money. Moreover, executives say that for many well-paid bankers, a good portion of their bonus compensation is in stock, whose value can decline if the performance of the bank lags.\n\nRepresentatives of several of the largest banks said much of their compensation budget covered expenses other than bonuses, like salaries, health care, pension plans and severance.\n\nStill, the compensation expense is the only publicly disclosed figure related to pay at the banks, and it is the best figure for calculating pay per worker.\n\nThis expense includes money for year-end bonuses. For high earners, bonuses can account for three-quarters of pay.\n\nCompensation is among the most cited causes of the financial crisis because bonuses were often tied to short-term gains, even if those gains disappeared later on. Still, as profits return, banks do not appear to be changing the absolute level of worker pay \u00d1 or the share of revenue dedicated to compensation.\n\nHistorically, investment banks have paid workers about 50 cents for every dollar of revenue. The average is lower at commercial banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, because they employ more people in retail branches where pay is lower.\n\nBut every dollar paid to workers is a dollar that cannot be used to expand the business or increase lending. Some of that revenue, too, could be used by bailed-out banks to pay back taxpayers.\n\nWall Street, of course, has a long history of high wages. Not all that long ago, most investment banks were private partnerships, and the workers were also typically the owners. Even when those firms began listing their shares on public stock exchanges, a standard was set in which half of their revenue was paid out to workers."}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "Four days after Bank of America shareholders voted to approve a merger with Merrill Lynch, Timothy J. Mayopoulos, the bank\u00d5s general counsel, was summoned to an executive suite.\n\nThere, Bank of America\u00d5s chief risk officer told Mr. Mayopoulos that he was no longer needed at the company, but she gave no explanation of the unexpected dismissal, according to two people briefed on the meeting.\n\nNow, the timing of Mr. Mayopoulos\u00d5s dismissal is coming under a spotlight as Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and other federal investigators examine why the bank\u00d5s executives did not tell shareholders about billions of dollars worth of bonuses as well as huge losses at Merrill Lynch before the deal.\n\nMr. Mayopoulos was let go the day the bank informed its board that Merrill was bleeding money at an unexpected pace. He was immediately escorted from the building without being permitted to return to his office, the people with knowledge of situation said. His dismissal came six days after Mr. Mayopoulos spoke with the bank\u00d5s chief financial officer about mounting losses at Merrill Lynch, which were not disclosed to shareholders before the deal closed.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5d like to know why he was dismissed,\u00d3 said Charles M. Elson, a Bank of America shareholder and a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u00d2If he was terminated because of disagreements on disclosure on Merrill, that\u00d5s relevant. It goes right back to the effectiveness of management. You can always disregard a general counsel\u00d5s advice, but the question is, Why did you?\u00d3\n\nAs general counsel, Mr. Mayopoulos was responsible for advising the bank on its disclosure decisions. It is unclear how he advised executives to handle the information on Merrill\u00d5s bonuses and losses, which some shareholders later said would have changed their mind about approving the merger.\n\nIn testimony to Mr. Cuomo\u00d5s staff in August, Mr. Mayopoulos cited legal ethics rules and declined to provide specifics on the advice he gave the bank. Mr. Cuomo asked the bank in a letter Tuesday to grant Mr. Mayopoulos and the bank\u00d5s other lawyers permission to respond. By invoking the confidentiality of legal advice, Bank of America was \u00d2hindering this office\u00d5s ability to make fair and fully informed decisions as to what charges, if any, to bring and whether individual Bank of America officers should be charged,\u00d3 Mr. Cuomo\u00d5s office wrote.\n\nBank of America has also cited attorney-client privilege in a separate case involving the Securities and Exchange Commission, with which the bank recently reached a $33 million settlement over disclosure issues. A federal judge who has blocked the settlement has also tried to get the bank to reveal more on the role played by Mr. Mayopoulos and the bank\u00d5s other lawyers, and the bank and the S.E.C. will file new documents with that judge on Wednesday. The chairman of a Congressional committee investigating the merger has also asked the bank to reveal documents related to these legal discussions.\n\nIn testimony to Mr. Cuomo\u00d5s staff, Joe L. Price, the chief financial officer, said he relied on Mr. Mayopoulos\u00d5s advice on Dec. 3, the day before the shareholder vote, for the bank\u00d5s decision not to disclose Merrill\u00d5s mounting losses. Mr. Mayopoulos responded to Mr. Cuomo\u00d5s staff that he in turn had spoken with outside counsel about the matter. The bank\u00d5s outside law firm was Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Merrill Lynch worked with Shearman & Sterling. Both firms declined to comment.\n\nKenneth D. Lewis, Bank of America\u00d5s chief executive, told Mr. Cuomo\u00d5s office this spring that Mr. Mayopoulos\u00d5s dismissal came at a time when the bank \u00d2had more executives than we needed because of this merger.\u00d3\n\nThe bank chose one of its own executives, Brian T. Moynihan, over Merrill Lynch\u00d5s general counsel to fill the vacancy. Mr. Moynihan held the position for about a month before being shifted to head the bank\u00d5s investment banking unit.\n\nThe departure of Mr. Mayopoulos, whose family still lives in Charlotte on the same street as Mr. Lewis, surprised executives at Merrill Lynch who had been meeting with him for weeks to figure out how the combined legal department would be arranged. He was involved in such a meeting when he was called in and dismissed, two people briefed on those discussions said.\n\nBank of America issued a statement that said it had not in fact defended itself by saying it relied on its lawyers. The bank said it believed it had followed disclosure rules.\n\nMr. Mayopoulos is now the general counsel of Fannie Mae. In a Feb. 2 recommendation letter provided by his lawyer, Ed Hinson, the bank said he had served \u00d2with distinction throughout his tenure with the company.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2The amazing thing about a guy like him is however he\u00d5s treated, he\u00d5ll do his duty,\u00d3 Mr. Hinson said. \u00d2He\u00d5s not going to reveal confidential information.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "It is nothing like a button-down Wall Street brokerage firm. Jeans, sweatshirts and sandals are common. The firm has not one, but two libraries, where textbooks on computer coding are stacked near academic finance journals dating to the 1960s. For a time, the d\u008ecor included light bulbs strung from the ceiling on various lengths of wire, each determined by a computerized random-number generator.\n\nIt is a quicksilver business and wildly lucrative. Mr. Shaw is said to be worth $2.7 billion, and today his firm manages $30 billion.\n\nAt Shaw, Mr. Summers, the professor, was often the student. The arrogant personal style that turned off some Harvard colleagues seemed to evaporate, Shaw traders say. Mr. Summers immersed himself in dynamic hedging, Libor rates and other financial arcana.\n\nHe seemed to fit in among Shaw\u00d5s math-loving \u00d2quants,\u00d3 as devotees of math-heavy quantitative investing are known. Traders joked that Mr. Summers was the first quant Treasury secretary because he had once ordered dollar bills to be printed with the transcendental number pi \u00d1 3.14159... \u00d1 as the serial number.\n\n\u00d2We could call or e-mail him anytime,\u00d3 a former Shaw trader said. \u00d2He always asked me more questions than I could ask him. He would dig through my entire way of thinking.\u00d3\n\nAt Harvard and at Shaw, Mr. Summers cultivated a small circle of financial professionals \u00d1 particularly hedge fund managers \u00d1 to serve as an informal brain trust. He consults with them on policy matters from his perch in the White House.\n\nAmong these insiders are Kenneth D. Brody and Frank P. Brosens, the founding partners of another hedge fund, Taconic Capital Advisors, for whom Mr. Summers did consulting work from 2004 to 2006.\n\nMr. Summers reached out to Mr. Brosens in December to discuss the Obama administration\u00d5s economic priorities. This year, he campaigned to have him run the federal office overseeing the $700 billion bailout program. Mr. Brosens withdrew his name from consideration last month.\n\nOthers in this inner circle include Nancy Zimmerman, a longtime friend and hedge fund manager in Boston; Laurence D. Fink, the chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, a large money management company that hopes to play a potentially lucrative role in the administration\u00d5s bank rescue plan; H. Rodgin Cohen, the chairman of the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, who was briefly considered for a senior Treasury post; and three other top fund managers, Orin S. Kramer, Ralph L. Schlosstein and Eric M. Mindich.\n\nFriends of Mr. Summers say he has always been meticulous about avoiding conflicts of interest and that he was just as careful at D. E. Shaw. For instance, Mr. Summers went to lengths to pay the Social Security taxes on payments he made to even occasional babysitters from the 1980s, said Jeremy Bulow, an economics professor at Stanford, who has known Mr. Summers since graduate school.\n\n\u00d2To Larry, it was not about figuring out where the line is and making sure you\u00d5re on one side of it,\u00d3 Mr. Bulow said. \u00d2He would never even get close to it.\u00d3\n\nIn addition to his salary at Shaw, Mr. Summers enjoyed growing wealth through investments in the firm\u00d5s funds. Unlike most hedge funds, which lost money as the markets plunged in 2008, Shaw posted returns of about 7 percent in its so-called macroeconomic fund. A separate multistrategy fund lost 8 percent, far less than most hedge funds.\n\nWhen investors rushed en masse to withdraw their money from hedge funds last year, Shaw asserted its right to block redemptions from its fund. An exception was made for Mr. Summers, however, because the White House job he was taking required him to divest.\n\nA spokesman for Shaw said Mr. Summers\u00d5s main job was not to act as a salesman. But in the fall of 2007, as the financial crisis simmered, Mr. Summers traveled to Dubai for a series of meetings with Shaw\u00d5s marketing staff and potential investors. Bankers from across the region flew in for the event. Mr. Summers spoke at several lavish dinners and met with local parties involved in Shaw\u00d5s real estate investments in the area, people briefed on his trip said.\n\nLast September, Mr. Summers explained to Shaw traders what appeared to be an aberration in a key interest rate, the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, thus helping its traders avoid losses. He spoke at the firm\u00d5s 20th anniversary gathering for its investors and at a prominent hedge fund investor conference in Boston, weeks before the presidential election. In December, he attended the firm\u00d5s annual holiday party, held in the American Museum of Natural History in New York, beneath the giant model of a blue whale.\n\nEven so, Mr. Summers, who, before the crisis broke out, spoke and wrote about the need for greater financial regulation, has not resisted the efforts to tighten up on hedge funds like Shaw. The administration, for instance, is moving toward closing a tax loophole that these funds have long enjoyed. A White House spokeswoman says his actions supporting hedge fund regulation prove he is not biased.\n\nSome people in the financial world say they have more confidence in the White House\u00d5s plans because of Mr. Summers\u00d5 time at D. E. Shaw.\n\n\u00d2He had insights into one of the best hedge funds in the world. That can only add value to the things the government is struggling with right now,\u00d3 said Robert Borden, chief investment officer of South Carolina\u00d5s pension fund, which has invested $350 million with Shaw. Mr. Borden met Mr. Summers to discuss how much money a large institution should allocate to hedge funds.\n\n\u00d2It was a nice perk to have access to some of his thoughts and insights,\u00d2 Mr. Borden said.\n\nMr. Summers\u00d5s experience in hedge funds might leave some wondering if he will return to private investing when his latest White House assignment ends, perhaps even to run his own lucrative fund.\n\nAsked about that, Mr. Shaw laughed. \u00d2Oh, boy, I have no idea,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2Thankfully he\u00d5s doing what he\u00d5s doing. I\u00d5m really glad he\u00d5s running this. It\u00d5s a scary time, and I can\u00d5t think of anybody I\u00d5d rather see there.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": " For months, Bank of America has been trying to keep secret its legal conversations at the end of last year about its coming merger with Merrill Lynch. So far, it has succeeded, mainly by arguing that those conversations should remain confidential because they are protected by attorney-client privilege.\n\nBut now, the bank is facing questions from a House panel, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, whose chairman, Representative Edolphus Towns, has told the bank that it cannot use attorney-client privilege when dealing with Congress.\n\nIf Mr. Towns has his way, Bank of America would be forced to reveal information that would then affect a range of other investigations into the merger, including one by the attorney general of New York and another by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn a sternly worded letter on Friday, Mr. Towns, a New York Democrat, said the bank must divulge when it became aware of the enormous losses at Merrill last year, when it received a commitment from the federal government for a second round of bailout money and what legal advice its management received about whether it had to disclose those developments to the bank's shareholders.\n\nMr. Towns gave the bank until noon on Monday to provide answers and relevant legal documents. He said it seemed that the bank was ''hiding information.'' The bank replied to Mr. Towns's committee late on Saturday, asking him to delay that request until after Tuesday, when Mr. Towns meets with Anne Finucane, the bank's chief strategy and marketing officer, who oversees public policy at the bank. But a spokesman for Mr. Towns said on Sunday that he was sticking to the deadline.\n\n''We appreciate and take very seriously the committee's important oversight role and have nothing but the strongest intent to work with the committee to help it understand these events,'' Kenneth D. Lewis, the bank's chief executive, said in a letter to Mr. Towns.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown that will be widely watched in both Washington and on Wall Street. Bank of America is trying to defuse the issue with the help of some high-powered lobbyists. It recently hired the Podesta Group, run by Tony Podesta, a prominent Democratic lobbyist, to contact Mr. Towns's staff.\n\nThe inquiry by the House panel is just one of many tussles involving the bank's merger with Merrill Lynch, and the bank noted in its reply to Mr. Towns's committee that any steps it takes before Congress could affect the other investigations. In particular, the bank said, if it voluntarily provides Congress with the legal advice that it received related to the merger, then it might waive the right to keep its legal advice private in its case before the S.E.C., which is scheduled to go to trial in February. The merger is also being examined by Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general of New York.\n\n''What makes it complicated is it's not just two parties, it's not just three parties, it's six or seven parties,'' said David Skeel, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who is overseeing the S.E.C. case. ''It's like a multiplayer chess game where each party is making different moves from a different strategic position and each party has a huge amount at stake.''\n\nThere is also a maze of issues underlying the investigations. While the S.E.C. case focused only on the bonuses paid out at Merrill before the merger, Mr. Towns and Mr. Cuomo are looking at surprise losses at Merrill as well as Bank of America's suggestion that it considered backing out of the deal last year as a result of the losses. Mr. Towns instructed the bank to tell its current and former employees that they should not assert attorney-client privilege when they are interviewed by his committee. "}

Their pay was not in the same league as the traders\u00d5 and investment bankers\u00d5, but they were paid more than they would have been paid for similar work in a different industry. And they shared in the reflected glow.\n\nSome were like Sanjeev Naraine, who was 22 when he walked into Bear Stearns\u00d5s headquarters in early 2000 for the first time and felt as if he was walking onto a movie set. Fast-moving, self-assured traders and bankers, top-of-the-line computers, a juicy steak dinner on the corporate account and a Town Car to drive him home. Mesmerized, he quit college to join the technology support staff.\n\nNow, Mr. Naraine says, for him, going to work is like going to a funeral. He is part of the \u00d2transition team\u00d3 in the fallen company\u00d5s merger with JPMorgan Chase, and he wistfully counts each day leading up to his last one, Oct. 31.\n\nAcross the river from Lehman Brothers\u00d5s headquarters, in Jersey City, the company\u00d5s support staff has mixed feelings about their more highly paid colleagues.\n\n\u00d2You can\u00d5t help but look at what\u00d5s gone on in Wall Street with lending and with derivative securities and you can\u00d5t help but be kind of upset,\u00d3 said a technology worker, who asked to remain anonymous because he did not want to be fired. \u00d2You guys have tanked our economy, you guys invented these things to get rich, and it backfired on us all.\u00d3\n\nIt will be many months before it is clear where Wall Street\u00d5s downward spiral will stop. Already, more than 120,000 jobs have been cut across the industry, and some analysts bumped their estimates upward by 10 to 20 percent last week after two investment banks, Lehman and Merrill Lynch, lost their independence. One rationale for mergers, like Merrill\u00d5s marriage to Bank of America, is to cut expenses and overlapping jobs.\n\nThe storyline has already played out at Bear, which was acquired by JPMorgan in March for $10 a share. The bank hired just about half of Bear\u00d5s 13,500 workers and kept about 600 in short-term transition teams. JPMorgan also tried to help Bear employees find new jobs through what it called its Talent Network and has now offered to share the network with Merrill and Lehman. \u00d2I think people feel generally relieved to be here given the market turmoil we\u00d5ve seen,\u00d3 said Jeff Urwin, a Bear employee who became the head of JPMorgan\u00d5s investment bank.\n\nSome from Bear say now that they feel fortunate to have fallen first, before the job market deteriorated further.\n\n\u00d2Who\u00d5d have thought we were the lucky ones by going down first?\u00d3 said Vincent Van Pelt, a Bear executive who is now the global head of equity derivatives and commodities for Standard Chartered, a British bank with a large presence in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nOne Lehman employee who works in London said: \u00d2A lot of people have put their heart and souls in these companies. They feel betrayed by a number of factors: the market, the management, the regulators.\u00d3 The employee, who did not want his name used because he did not have permission to speak with the media, added, \u00d2A friend of mine who was at the Bear sent me an e-mail saying, \u00d4I don\u00d5t have to imagine what you\u00d5re going through.\u00d5 \u00d3\n\nThe Friday before Lehman filed for bankruptcy, Sept. 12, should have been an unabashedly joyous day for Lance Bylow, a senior vice president in Lehman\u00d5s private investment management business. His wife, a part-time event planner, gave birth to their second child. But Mr. Bylow\u00d5s job at Lehman remained in question until Monday, when Barclays Capital added it to the units it purchased.\n\nMr. Van Pelt, the Bear executive, said London was home for him and his family, but he was so shaken by Bear\u00d5s collapse that he was receptive to an offer to move to Singapore. He sat down with his wife and three children and they jointly made the decision.\n\n\u00d2If you\u00d5re some place for a long time, you just kind of get used to it,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2This opened up our vistas.\u00d3\n\nOne Bear worker who tried to play it safe was Doug Pugliese, an investment banker who said he saw trouble on the horizon beginning in 2006. He and his wife believed the easy credit could not last forever, so he purchased a house in an area in Pennsylvania that was less expensive than the New York suburbs. It meant nights away from his family, but a paid-off house.\n\nThen, in March, even Mr. Pugliese lost out. His Bear stock holdings crumbled, and a hedge he put on to short financial stocks became a wash when JPMorgan acquired Bear. With newborn twins and a toddler on his lap, Mr. Pugliese, 43, quickly pushed aside notions of leaving the industry. He now works at a valuation consulting firm called Marshall & Stevens.\n\n\u00d2The thing about investment banking is it\u00d5s so grueling that you are always daydreaming about going off and doing something interesting,\u00d3 Mr. Pugliese said. \u00d2Your heart is crying out, but your wallet is telling you there\u00d5s nothing else out there that is going to have this kind of payoff.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": " Six months after accepting a financial lifeline from Washington, a newly profitable Goldman Sachs is pushing to return the billions of taxpayer dollars that it received in an effort to extricate itself from heightened government control.\n\nGoldman, which rode out the final, tumultuous months of 2008 with the help of a federal rescue, reported strong quarterly profits on Monday and said that it would seek to raise money in the capital markets to repay the government.\n\nIf successful, Goldman would become the first major bank to return funds received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Such a step would probably enable Goldman -- long one of the most lucrative places to work on Wall Street -- to free itself from government-imposed restrictions on compensation.\n\nMany analysts welcomed the news as the latest in a series of signs that the financial industry is stabilizing. But others warned of a looming divide between a handful of banks like Goldman, which may be strong enough to return their TARP money, and the many others that are too weak to go without government funds.\n\nIt is unclear how quickly Goldman, which was also a beneficiary of a separate government rescue of the American International Group, might be allowed to return the $10 billion it accepted last October.\n\nIn a conference call Tuesday morning, Goldman's chief financial officer, David A. Viniar, said Goldman never viewed the taxpayer money as long-term capital.\n\n''We view it as our duty to return the funds as long as we can do it without negatively impacting our financial profile,'' Mr. Viniar said.\n\nWhile Goldman's latest results bolster its case for untangling itself from TARP, federal regulators are nonetheless concerned about the health of the broader financial industry and the implications such a move might have for other institutions. Goldman is not allowed to return the money without the approval of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which both declined to comment on Monday.\n\n''The issue is really, will the government give Goldman special dispensation to get out first?'' said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''Goldman can walk the halls of Congress waving a check, but is it in the best interest of the marketplace for them to pay it back?''\n\nGoldman indicated in early February that it would seek to repay the funds, and since then, several other banks have said they would like to do the same. Not all banks, however, are likely to bounce back as quickly as Goldman, despite expectations that other banks will report strong results for the first quarter.\n\nGoldman announced profits of $1.66 billion in the quarter, or $3.39 a share, a strong comeback from a loss in late 2008. Goldman's profit was propelled by record revenue of $6.56 billion in its fixed-income, currency and commodities unit, where mortgage and other credit instruments are traded. Over all, Goldman's revenue was $9.43 billion, up 13 percent from the first quarter a year ago.\n\n/Mr. Viniar said on Tuesday morning that the bank was able to generate much of its revenue by trading ''plain vanilla'' investments. Margins were higher than usual, he said, in part because of the disappearance of some of Goldman's former competitors, like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.\n\n''Many of our traditional competitors have retreated from the marketplace,'' Mr. Viniar said.\n\nGoldman reported its results a day ahead of schedule, setting a positive tone for other bank results expected in the coming week. While several small banks have returned TARP money, Goldman so far is alone among large institutions to seek to do so.\n\nLast Tuesday, Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, visited Washington to speak before an industry conference, and to meet with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Though rumors have swirled about Goldman's payback, it was only last week in that meeting that Mr. Blankfein formally asked to return the money and detailed his plan to raise more private capital. Goldman said on Monday that it would seek to raise $5 billion by selling new common stock and use the proceeds, along with other funds, to repay the government."}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "Jed S. Rakoff, a United States District Court judge in Manhattan, is not one to rubber-stamp administrative decisions.\n\nKnown as a maverick in legal circles, Judge Rakoff has in the past found the death penalty illegal, inserted himself into corporate governance reform at WorldCom, and pushed for the release of documents in private settlements.\n\nNow he is tussling with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Bank of America, which will both file reports to him Monday detailing who knew what about $3.6 billion in bonuses paid out by Merrill Lynch just before Bank of America took it over last year.\n\nThe Merrill payouts have been at the center of hearings in Congress as well as an investigation by the New York attorney general. But Judge Rakoff is the first to demand that Bank of America reveal who decided not to disclose the bonuses to shareholders before the merger with Merrill closed.\n\nIn an interview last week, shortly after he rejected a settlement between the agency and the bank that was meant to put the matter to rest, he remembered a time when executives were held more directly accountable for actions taken by their companies.\n\nDecades ago, when he began his career in the securities fraud unit of the Southern District of New York, prosecutors placed greater accountability on individual executives at companies, he recalled. Charges tended to be filed mostly against those people, rather than against the corporation.\n\n\u00d2The feeling then,\u00d3 he said, \u00d2was if a crime had been committed, it was important to discover who the persons were who made the wrongful decisions.\u00d3\n\nNow Judge Rakoff is raising questions about executives at Bank of America, as well as the S.E.C.\u00d5s logic in imposing a $33 million fine on the bank. At a hearing Aug. 11, he said it appeared the bank had \u00d2effectively lied to its shareholders\u00d3 about Merrill\u00d5s bonuses, which he said had been paid by American taxpayers, since the bank received a second bailout shortly afterward.\n\nAnd besides, he wanted to know, shouldn\u00d5t a much higher fine be imposed directly on \u00d2the individuals who were responsible\u00d3 for the mess?\n\nIt is not the first time Judge Rakoff has ruffled feathers in the business world. In 2003, for example, he refused to approve what he saw as a low settlement the S.E.C. had negotiated with WorldCom, the phone company that collapsed in an $11 billion accounting fraud.\n\nLawyers said Judge Rakoff is known for his push for transparency, which he believes is needed for the courts to keep the public\u00d5s confidence. For instance, he has some of the strictest rules limiting what sorts of material in cases before him may be kept confidential, said Gregory Diskant, a lawyer who worked with Judge Rakoff in the 1970s, when they were both federal prosecutors. (Judge Rakoff also recently ruled in favor of The New York Times in a freedom of information act case.)\n\n\u00d2Everything needs to be public,\u00d3 the judge said. \u00d2The legitimacy of the courts comes from the fact that they reason openly, on the record, based on facts.\u00d3\n\nThe facts, of course, have been particularly elusive in Bank of America\u00d5s merger with Merrill Lynch. Even after a series of hearings before Congress, and an investigation by the New York attorney general, it remains unclear who at the bank knew what about Merrill\u00d5s bonuses or its mounting losses on the eve of the merger. The judge will release the bank\u00d5s and commission\u00d5s filings on Monday.\n\nAt the heart of Judge Rakoff\u00d5s inquiry is a question of blame. The S.E.C.\u00d5s complaint against Bank of America made no charges against individuals, meaning that the fine the agency imposed would be paid by the bank\u00d5s shareholders \u00d1 the very people who were allegedly harmed by the bank\u00d5s secrecy.\n\nRewarding \u00d1 and punishing \u00d1 the right parties was at the fore of Judge Rakoff\u00d5s thinking in the WorldCom case six years ago. Shareholders of that company had already lost out. So when the judge forced the S.E.C. to increase the $500 million fine it was levying against the firm to $750 million, he also demanded that the money be paid out to the company\u00d5s shareholders, rather than to the agency.\n\nBut he also decided not to make the fine too high.\n\n\u00d2I could have put the company out of business,\u00d3 he acknowledged. \u00d2But it seemed to me that would have been 60,000 jobs needlessly lost.\u00d3\n\nTo put the company on a healthier track, he then oversaw a review of WorldCom\u00d5s corporate governance practices.\n\nIt is the kind of intervention that would make many a spine shiver on Wall Street, where banks have generally tried to keep the government out of their business even as they have accepted bailout money.\n\nWhen asked if he is anti-Wall Street, however, Judge Rakoff sat straight up. \u00d2The plaintiffs bar sometimes thinks I\u00d5m pro,\u00d3 he said, adding that he had dismissed a number of shareholder cases against companies for lack of evidence.\n\nChanging the subject, he rose and walked to a corner of his office, where he pointed to a photo montage from the court\u00d5s annual Courthouse Follies. There stood three singing hobos, judges all, performing a song written by Judge Rakoff. One of his singing partners had a familiar look \u00d1 it was Sonia Sotomayor, the recently appointed Supreme Court justice. She wore a red bandanna, while Judge Rakoff sported a fake black tooth and smudges on his cheeks.\n\n\u00d2I have a past of making a fool of myself,\u00d3 he said, chuckling.\n\nHe also presented a visitor with a copy of a mock legal opinion he recently wrote \u00d1 this one in favor of a banker. The ruling, written partly as a poem, was based on \u00d2The Merchant of Venice\u00d3 by Shakespeare. Judge Rakoff ruled that Shylock, the Venetian money lender, should win his appeal to receive some recompense from Antonio, a borrower \u00d1 even if it wasn\u00d5t a pound of flesh.\n\nThe judge declined to discuss his plans for Bank of America, but lawyers said the judge might hold another hearing with both sides after receiving the filings and responses he has requested. If he does not approve the settlement, the S.E.C. could choose to drop the case, renegotiate the settlement or take Bank of America to court.\n\nIn the meantime, Wall Street could be in for a bit more blunt talk from the bench.\n\n\u00d2The S.E.C. has to have noticed by now that most of the country agrees with the sentiments expressed by Rakoff,\u00d3 said John C. Coffee, a Columbia Law School professor who has taught a course along with Judge Rakoff for 21 years. \u00d2This builds up pressure on Bank of America and the S.E.C.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "Two months after Steven Rattner left Wall Street for Washington, his private investment company is facing a widening investigation into corruption in public pension funds \u00d1 and fighting for its future.\n\nThe authorities contend the firm of Steven Rattner, left, has had pension dealings with Hank Morris, right.\n\nAs state and federal authorities examine Mr. Rattner\u00d5s dealings with the New York State retirement fund, questions are emerging about his efforts to gain business from several other public funds, including ones in New Mexico and New York City. His private investment firm, the Quadrangle Group, is moving to calm anxious pension managers, who have entrusted the firm with hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nMr. Rattner, who is leading the Obama administration\u00d5s efforts to revamp the auto industry, has left his small but prominent firm in a bind. Because he was integral to Quadrangle, investors can try to withhold additional money that they have pledged to the firm now that he has left.\n\nThe deadline for their decision is Friday, according to four people familiar with the matter. For Quadrangle, the stakes are high. If its investors balk, the amount of fees that it collects annually on its funds would fall to about $19 million, from $35 million, according to a Quadrangle investor. Mr. Rattner\u00d5s firm also would lose its ability to make investments in new companies.\n\nNo charges have been filed against Mr. Rattner, who did not respond to e-mail messages on Tuesday, or against Quadrangle, whose executives declined to comment.\n\nWhile Quadrangle\u00d5s funds have not suffered as much as some other private equity funds, its investors have suffered losses in other parts of their portfolios. Some of them might try to capitalize on the inquiry to avoid making good on their pledges.\n\nAnother crucial question, however, is whether money from one Quadrangle fund was used to lure investors to a second fund. That possibility that might expose Quadrangle to investor lawsuits.\n\nQuadrangle hired a firm that had been run by Hank Morris, a now-indicted associate of New York\u00d5s former comptroller, to help gain business in New York, state and federal authorities contend. While the New York fund accounted for a only a small portion of Quadrangle\u00d5s investments, the prestige associated with it helped the firm lure other big investors.\n\nQuadrangle also hired Mr. Morris\u00d5s firm, Searle, to help raise money from pension funds in New York City, New Mexico and Los Angeles, according to a person with knowledge of the arrangement.\n\nMr. Rattner was personally involved in discussions about using Mr. Morris to gain pension business. In 2005, for instance, Mr. Rattner discussed hiring Mr. Morris with the head of the New Jersey pension fund, who told him such a move would not benefit Quadrangle, according to a person briefed on the investigation, which is being led by the attorney general of New York and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMr. Rattner, a major Democratic fund-raiser, has social and political connections. He is friends with the mayor of New York City, Michael R. Bloomberg, and Quadrangle manages the mayor\u00d5s personal fortune. Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement on Tuesday that he had no plans to move his money and that Quadrangle was doing \u00d2a great job.\u00d3\n\nMr. Rattner headed much of Quadrangle\u00d5s effort to raise money from pension funds in 2005, when the firm attracted money from the New York fund and others.\n\nMr. Rattner forged close personal ties in New Mexico, which invested $20 million in Quadrangle. He met with Senator Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat from that state, on at least one occasion, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting. From about 2004 until early this year, Quadrangle also employed the senator\u00d5s son as an associate.\n\nA spokeswoman for Senator Bingaman said that the senator\u00d5s son did not raise money for Quadrangle, but instead helped make investments. Senator Bingaman was not involved in the pension process, she said.\n\nThe accusations involving Quadrangle were included in an S.E.C. complaint last week that detailed a three-year-long investigation into corruption in New York state\u00d5s pension plan. Quadrangle and several other private equity funds, among them the Carlyle Group, were named in the complaint.\n\nMr. Rattner turned to Mr. Morris after meeting Josh Wolf-Powers, then managing director of private markets for the New York City comptroller, about the beginning of 2005. Mr. Wolf-Powers told Mr. Rattner that he could not think of any investment firm that had persuaded the city\u00d5s pension fund to invest without using a placement agent.\n\nMr. Rattner left the meeting irritated that his own considerable connections did not seem to be enough. He soon hired Mr. Morris.\n\nPayments to placement advisers like Mr. Morris, can be legal but often raise questions about conflicts of interest and would be illegal if used to bribe public officials.\n\nAfter Mr. Rattner left, Quadrangle executives flew to California to try to persuade three pension funds to stick with the firm.\n\nBefore Mr. Rattner left, Quadrangle stood to earn about $60 million more in management fees on its second fund, which is allowed to make new investments through the end of 2010. The partners at the firm are now offering to cut about $5 million of those fees. In early April, Quadrangle organized a conference call for its investors. Calpers, the big California pension fund, pushed other investors to demand that Quadrangle reduce its fees, according to two investors who were on the call. The Pennsylvania teachers\u00d5 pension fund was among those willing to support the firm without any concessions.\n\nOne investor, Amos Hostetter, who made a fortune in the cable business, said some Quadrangle investors have committed too much money to such private equity investors and are pushing to reduce fees. But he said it would be unwise to cut fees drastically, because such a move would force Quadrangle to dismiss some employees who are managing its investments.\n\n\u00d2It would hurt everyone\u00d5s financial interest to see the fund reduced in size,\u00d3 Mr. Hostetter said."}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "After 26 years as one of the most politically connected investment bankers on Wall Street, Steven Rattner finally took a job in Washington \u00d1 only it is not quite the one friends and business associates thought it would be.\n\nSteven Rattner, who made his mark as a communications media financier on Wall Street, is dealing with the failure of a giant industry.\n\nWashington buzzed that Mr. Rattner, a big name in the New York media world who, friends say, aspires to a cabinet post like Treasury secretary, would be named the car czar of the Obama administration. Instead, he is one of 14 people on a committee that is orchestrating the rescue of the giant automakers.\n\nStill, Mr. Rattner, a well-known media banker, is playing a central role as car czar lite, traveling to Detroit to visit plants, meeting with the automakers\u00d5 bankers, unions and bondholders, and advising the White House on which companies seem salvageable and how. If he succeeds, he may get a chance at a larger job in the administration.\n\nThat is a big if. He has to push the car companies to overhaul decades-old practices, persuade his former colleagues on Wall Street to lower their demands on the automakers\u00d5 debt payments and appeal to union leaders who may be turned off by Mr. Rattner\u00d5s financial success.\n\nMr. Rattner said in an interview that he has long been interested in returning to Washington, where he worked as a newspaper reporter 30 years ago, and that he hoped to stay on for some time to work on aspects of the financial crisis.\n\n\u00d2In the fall, as the economic crisis intensified, it became clearer and clearer to me that this was a moment of historic importance,\u00d3 Mr. Rattner said, \u00d2and if one was ever to have an interest in serving your country in the area of economic policy, this was the moment.\u00d3\n\nMr. Rattner has been among the most politically connected people in the banking industry. He and his wife, Maureen White, who together have been referred to by New York magazine as the \u00d2D.N.C.\u00d5s A.T.M.,\u00d3 have hosted many Democratic fund-raisers at their lavish apartment on Fifth Avenue. They were initially Clinton supporters, but they hosted events for Barack Obama after he sealed the nomination.\n\nAmong his friends, it has become a parlor game to guess where Mr. Rattner might be posted next. His current job description as a special counselor in the Treasury Department, according to a White House press release, includes the eventual option of moving on to manage a different aspect of the financial crisis.\n\nMr. Rattner went to Wall Street in the early 1980s, after his stint as a reporter in Washington, and rose through the ranks at Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley before becoming deputy chief executive at the investment bank Lazard in the 1990s.\n\nIn 2000, after a power struggle at Lazard, Mr. Rattner co-founded an investment firm, Quadrangle Capital, specializing in private equity investing focused on communications media. Last year, Quadrangle began managing the personal fortune of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York \u00d1 a longtime friend of Mr. Rattner\u00d5s.\n\nQuadrangle\u00d5s funds have performed well, on average, though the firm has canceled plans to start a third fund because of Mr. Rattner\u00d5s departure.\n\nFriends of Mr. Rattner say it would be hard to find a better auto industry analyst. Orin Kramer, a hedge fund manager and important Obama fund-raiser, called Mr. Rattner \u00d2a superstar.\u00d3\n\nPaul J. Taubman, head of investment banking at Morgan Stanley, said \u00d2he\u00d5s a very fast study.\u00d3 And Henry Kravis, the private equity financier, said \u00d2he\u00d5s thoughtful, thorough and smart.\u00d3\n\nA former colleague of Mr. Rattner\u00d5s pointed to his dealings with Cablevision as an example of his toughness and business savvy. When Quadrangle invested in the cable company in 2002, Mr. Rattner told the Dolan family, which runs the company, that he would not support an expansion into satellite businesses. When the Dolans decided to pursue satellite opportunities, Mr. Rattner did not back down, and Quadrangle sold its position in Cablevision.\n\nOne thing that is clear: Mr. Rattner knows how to make money. Not only has he stockpiled a personal fortune, but Quadrangle\u00d5s two private equity funds have performed well, despite some soured investments.\n\nThe first Quadrangle fund returned 15 to 20 percent, according to one investor. The second, which has yet to use all its capital to complete its investment portfolio, is already showing single-digit gains. Quadrangle also ran a hedge fund that lost 25 percent last year, before the firm closed it and returned investors\u00d5 money.\n\nMr. Rattner\u00d5s Wall Street ties slowed the process of his appointment, according to two people briefed on the Obama administration\u00d5s discussions. The administration worried that Mr. Rattner might have a conflict in dealing with Cerberus Capital Management, the investment firm that controlled Chrysler, because his firm was involved in a difficult transaction with Cerberus, centering on a magazine company that Quadrangle created in 2007.\n\nAt that time, Cerberus led a group of investors that lent money to the magazine company. At the end of last year, the magazine company broke its debt agreements. The situation is now being handled without Mr. Rattner, who has resigned from Quadrangle, and Cerberus is taking control of the magazines.\n\nThe Obama administration decided not to have an independent car czar, as was proposed in a House bill late last year. Instead, the administration chose to use a task force, giving President Obama the ability to be more directly involved in seeking solutions to the auto industry\u00d5s problems.\n\nMr. Rattner said his communications media banking background was an asset, as he could approach auto industry issues with a neutral view and help decide how much taxpayer capital to commit and to whom.\n\n\u00d2We\u00d5re making an investment decision,\u00d3 Mr. Rattner said. \u00d2We\u00d5re not running these auto companies. We are helping them restructure and reposition themselves for the future.\u00d3\n\nAlthough Mr. Rattner is friendly with many communications media leaders, he has been wary of the publicity his position has brought and at first resisted requests to be interviewed. He has long had a close friendship with the publisher of The New York Times, Arthur Sulzberger Jr.\n\nAs the most powerful member of the auto task force, Mr. Rattner is trying to jolt the industry into action with firm messages, like the one last week to Chrysler that it was unlikely to survive as an independent company.\n\nMr. Rattner believes General Motors has a greater chance of survival on its own, though he was the bearer of bad news last month when G.M.\u00d5s chairman, Rick Wagoner, was asked to step down.\n\nThere is no official head of the auto task force, but people in the auto industry say that Mr. Rattner seems to call the shots, and he is the highest-ranking task force official within Treasury. Most of the force is made up of younger people from Wall Street.\n\nMr. Rattner is viewed as having an afterlife in some other role at Treasury after this auto plan gets set, which should happen in about six months, according to people briefed on the matter.\n\nMr. Rattner, it turns out, has pondered the auto question before. In the 1970s, he wrote about the government\u00d5s rescue of Chrysler as a reporter for The New York Times. This time around, of course, Mr. Rattner does not get to write the article, though he will have great say over how it turns out."}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "The financial giant Goldman Sachs spent tens of millions of dollars to bail out two senior executives last fall who were short on cash, according to the bank\u00d5s proxy statement filed on Friday.\n\nIn an unusual move, Goldman bought back stakes in some internal investment funds from Jon Winkelried, the bank\u00d5s co-chief operating officer, and Gregory K. Palm, its general counsel.\n\nBoth executives are among the largest shareholders in the bank, owning more than a million shares each, and directors were concerned that a large sale of Goldman shares by the two men would alarm investors during a period of market turmoil, according to a person briefed on the matter.\n\nTo avoid the stock sales, Goldman paid Mr. Winkelried, who retired last month, $19.7 million to purchase about 30 percent of his investments in internal hedge funds and private equity investments.\n\nThe bank paid $38.3 million to Mr. Palm for about a quarter of his investments.\n\nSoon after the bank aided the two executives, Warren E. Buffett invested $5 billion in Goldman, and the bank\u00d5s top four executives agreed not to sell more than 10 percent of their stock for three years.\n\nMr. Palm was not one of the four barred from selling stock, but Mr. Winkelried was, and that agreement remains in place even though he has retired.\n\nThe proxy also says that one bank executive, who is not identified, has pledged 500,000 shares of Goldman stock in exchange for loans from the bank.\n\nThe executives are not the only Goldman employees who have faced a liquidity squeeze. Goldman also offered loans earlier this month to more than 1,000 employees who invested in its internal investment funds. About 10 percent of those employees have indicated interest in the loans, according to a person briefed on the matter. The employees will use the loans to meet their contractual obligations to put more money into the bank\u00d5s internal investment funds.\n\nFew banks were as high-flying as Goldman when Wall Street was riding high. In 2006, the bank paid more than 50 people more than $20 million each. But longtime partners at the firm, like Mr. Palm and Mr. Winkelried, have been particularly stung by the slide in its stock, and Goldman has been among the banks that have made margin calls on their own workers.\n\nGoldman was the last Wall Street firm to go public, and many partners there, current and former, have held onto their stock since the offering 10 years ago because they did not want to pay the large tax bills attached to the profits that would accrue from sales of their shares.\n\nSome partners and other employees there borrowed against their stock for living expenses or to make other investments in areas like hedge funds and private equity funds.\n\nIn a much-noticed sign of the times, Mr. Winkelried, a former investment banker, put his estate in Nantucket on the market last fall for $55 million. He has since lowered the price. He also owns a home in Short Hills, N.J., and a horse farm in Colorado.\n\nMr. Winkelried spent 27 years at the bank, working in areas like leveraged finance and rates and commodities before being named a senior executive. Mr. Palm still works at Goldman, where he has been head or co-head of the legal department since 1992, when he joined the bank from the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. In 2007, he endowed a professorship in economics at his alma mater, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Last fall, he represented Goldman before a Senate panel that focused in part on bank compensation.\n\nMr. Palm and Mr. Winkelried did not return calls requesting comment on Friday.\n\nGoldman\u00d5s chief, Lloyd C. Blankfein, and six other senior executives took no bonuses last year, the proxy confirmed, though they received some stock that was awarded to them in previous years.\n\nGoldman will hold its annual meeting on May 8.

{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "James D\u00d5Agostino craned his neck to get a view of the Morgan Stanley chief executive John J. Mack in the hope that the Wall Street titan would be subjected to a firestorm of criticism in a reckoning before Congress.\n\nBarney Frank, head of the financial services committee, said that the only way to get credit flowing again was to work with existing financial institutions.\n\nAfter participating in a protest last weekend at Mr. Mack\u00d5s home in Rye, N.Y., Mr. D\u00d5Agostino said he was eager to see lawmakers \u00d2go after him. And the others, too.\u00d3\n\nBut inside the House chamber where Mr. Mack sat shoulder to shoulder with Vikram S. Pandit, Kenneth D. Lewis, and the heads of five other too-big-to-fail banks leaning on government support, lawmakers instead delivered the equivalent of a slow burn.\n\n\u00d2There is in the country a great deal of anger about the financial institutions, including those represented here,\u00d3 Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee said, gazing at the row of executives. But, Mr. Frank continued, it would be impractical to scrap the entire financial system and start anew. \u00d2We have no option if we are to get credit flowing in this country other than to work with the existing institutions,\u00d3 he said.\n\nBank of America. Citigroup. Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley. These are the among the banks that the public blames for creating the mess that ravaged financial markets and ripped into the economy.\n\nThey and others that have taken in billions of dollars in hard-earned taxpayer dollars are widely perceived not to be returning the favor to the nation. Some say they are curbing lending while continuing to dish out millions in executive pay. But they are also the giants of the banking world that lawmakers are counting on to haul the economy back onto its feet.\n\nThis \u00d2dilemma,\u00d3 as Mr. Frank described it, led some lawmakers to walk a finer line with the bankers than had been the case with the heads of the Big Three automakers, who have also sought billions in support to shore up their teetering industry.\n\nSo, at the first hearing to call banking chiefs to account for how they have spent a collective $165 billion in taxpayer money, the pitchforks were tabled \u00d1 for the most part.\n\n\u00d2You once lived behind a one-way mirror, unaccountable to the public at large,\u00d3 said Representative Paul E. Kanjorksi, a Democrat from Pennsylvania. \u00d2When you took taxpayer money you moved into a fishbowl.\u00d3\n\nThe love-hate relationship with Wall Street dates back to the days when the financial district was settled by the Dutch. But the 1930s holds the greatest echoes to today. Back then, lawmakers were looking for answers behind the 1929 stock market crash, and for years they hauled bankers into contentious hearings.\n\nThe sessions led to a large-scale makeover of financial regulation and left the reputation of the industry scarred for decades.\n\nThe issues are different this time, but the accusations are similar. Wall Street has been accused of letting greed blind its leaders to responsibility \u00d1 and some of the chiefs acknowledged as much.\n\nMr. Mack offered a full-throated mea culpa for the bank\u00d5s role in fueling the crisis (\u00d2We are sorry for it,\u00d3 he said). Mr. Pandit, the head of Citigroup, pledged to cut his salary to $1 a year until the bank returned to profitability and took personal responsibility for the \u00d2mistake\u00d3 of even thinking about buying a new $50 million private jet after getting government financing. \u00d2I get the new reality, and I will make sure Citi gets it as well,\u00d3 he declared.\n\nLloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u00d5s chief executive, acknowledged \u00d2public anger at our industry.\u00d3 Mr. Lewis of Bank of America, who occasionally grew testy and red-faced at questions about lending, told lawmakers that his bank had \u00d2every incentive to lend.\u00d3\n\nBut that was about where the contrition stopped.\n\nFor the most part, the bankers focused the lawmakers\u00d5 attention on an armory of data and figures they hoped would show, contrary to public perception, that they had increased lending despite a worsening economy, and modified tens of thousands of mortgages for troubled homeowners since receiving injections of capital from the government last autumn.\n\nUntil recently, none of the banks had disclosed any information on their use of taxpayer money, and they were not required to do so when it was given to them. But in recent weeks, reports of multibillion-dollar bonus pools for bank employees, Super Bowl parties and decked-out corporate jets fueled public outrage about what some view as the government\u00d5s largesse.\n\nOne lawmaker from Florida, Alan Grayson, said he had received 500 e-mail messages from residents of his district in anticipation of the hearing. One woman suggested that Wall Street bonuses should be used to build new schools. Another said the chiefs of Wall Street should go to jail.\n\nThe bankers said they could track the flow of government money through their companies and pledged that no taxpayer funds were being used for such luxuries.\n\nBut no one questioned the chiefs on the bonuses they paid to their rank and file. The New York comptroller has estimated that the industry paid employees about $18 billion in bonuses."}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "It sounds like something Washington\u00d5s pay czar might propose to rein in runaway bonuses on Wall Street.\n\nTie executives\u00d5 compensation to their company\u00d5s stock price. Withhold big paydays for years. Claw back bonuses if things go wrong. And force risk-loving traders to gamble with their own money, not just their company\u00d5s.\n\nIn fact, those strictures were part of a compensation plan that Merrill Lynch adopted voluntarily in 2006 \u00d1 two years before the company collapsed into the arms of Bank of America.\n\nBut the Merrill program, which was supposed to align its top employees\u00d5 pay with the company\u00d5s long-term performance, did not keep workers from taking risks that nearly sank the brokerage giant. And some of its senior executives still stand to collect millions of dollars in stock under the plan.\n\nAs the Obama administration\u00d5s pay czar, Kenneth R. Feinberg, contemplates curbing compensation for the top 100 executives at each of the seven companies that received big bailouts \u00d1 including Bank of America \u00d1 the Merrill experience raises some sobering questions.\n\nCan Washington really control outsize pay on Wall Street, which many critics say fueled this crisis? And can Mr. Feinberg and federal regulators ensure that their plans will work?\n\nMost of the financial industry, after all, is out of Mr. Feinberg\u00d5s reach. And after the bailouts, many banks are moving toward paying employees more in the form of stock, rather than in cash, and spreading out workers\u00d5 payouts, much as Merrill did a few years ago.\n\nAt Merrill Lynch \u00d1 whose 2008 bonuses have come under sharp scrutiny in Congress \u00d1 some employees stand to profit from the 2006 incentive plan, which was turbo-charged by the company\u00d5s own money. The payments, due in January, are outside Mr. Feinberg\u00d5s purview, because they were guaranteed before pay restrictions were imposed on bailed-out banks. But the office of the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, who is investigating the 2008 payouts, has questioned at least one Merrill executive about the 2006 plan.\n\nRobert Stickler, a spokesman for Bank of America, said the coming Merrill payouts would be awarded as scheduled. Since the payments were tied to Merrill\u00d5s performance over four years, including a dismal 2007, some of the money has already been clawed back. Such punitive features, Mr. Stickler said, resemble some of the potential solutions the bank is considering. \u00d2In some aspects, that\u00d5s where we have been going in compensation in working with Feinberg\u00d5s office, so it is a sort of template,\u00d3 Mr. Stickler said.\n\nThe Merrill plan, copies of which were reviewed by The New York Times, was authorized by the firm\u00d5s board and recommended by Towers Perrin, a compensation consulting firm.\n\nUnder the 2006 plan, top Merrill executives contributed a part of their bonuses from the prior year to an incentive plan that was then converted into stock. If Merrill did well, the firm doled out more shares to the employees at the end of each year. The plan was repeated over three years, and employees could not sell their stock until 2010.\n\nCompensation experts who reviewed the plan commended much of it. They noted that the 34 Merrill executives included lost all of the money they put in for 2007, because Merrill performed poorly that year. But the main failure, they said, was that Merrill used leverage to juice its employees\u00d5 returns in good years.\n\nAs of this week, some managers have made a 9 percent return on their investments in the plan, although top executives have lost 17 percent. But both groups have fared better than an ordinary shareholder would have with similar investments in Merrill stock. Those investors would have lost 45 percent.\n\n\u00d2What we have here is something that was by and large good, and now the spotlight is on plans like this,\u00d3 said Lucian A. Bebchuk, a professor at Harvard Law School who has studied compensation. \u00d2But there are elements that could be improved on.\u00d3\n\nThe Merrill bonus plan was controversial from the start. It was created by Ahmass L. Fakahany, Merrill\u00d5s former co-president and chief operating officer, as part of a broader pay overhaul that also placed greater limits on workers\u00d5 ability to sell company stock and increased the amount of their pay that would come in stock.\n\nFor the top six executives, Merrill contributed $1.5 million for every $2 million each executive invested in the plan, leveraging the possible returns. For the next 28 workers in the plan, Merrill paid in an amount two and a half times their investments. That meant that the workers started out ahead, no matter how the shares performed.\n\n\u00d2That\u00d5s an awful lot of leverage,\u00d3 said Brian Foley, a compensation consultant in White Plains. \u00d2Would you risk a buck in order to make six bucks? Yeah, you would. Maybe that\u00d5s why people there were focused on the upside and not the risks.\u00d3\n\nA year into the Merrill plan, a $2 million investment by a senior executive was worth $11.5 million. Merrill\u00d5s subsequent losses in 2007, though, meant that the money invested that year would be forfeited, essentially clawing back part of old bonuses.\n\nCompensation experts who reviewed the Merrill plan wondered if it should have applied to more employees. Rank-and-file workers also take risks that can jeopardize a bank.\n\nMerrill might also have used a longer-term measure than a single year\u00d5s results to decide how many shares to grant executives, Professor Bebchuk said.\n\nAnd the plan also contained a provision that would automatically award top workers more stock in the event that Merrill was sold \u00d1 which it was.\n\n\u00d2Hindsight in these plans is 20/20,\u00d3 said Charles M. Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u00d2Feinberg is going to be coming up with a model for the bailed-out banks, and the question is, will he use a model like this? He can\u00d5t possibly know what the next few years will bring for these companies.\u00d3\n\nIn January, the Merrill plan will expire, and the stock held within it will be awarded to Merrill executives who are still at Bank of America, or those who have retired. Most Merrill executives in the plan have already broken even, and the top six will if Bank of America\u00d5s share price reaches $30 by January, from $17.35 now.\n\nBut for a regular investor who put in money with the same timing, a break-even by then would not be possible unless the stock quadrupled."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " What does the worst recession in a generation look like?\n\nIt is both deep and broad. Every state in the country, with the exception of a band stretching from the Dakotas down to Texas, is now shedding jobs at a rapid pace. And even that band has recently begun to suffer, because of the sharp fall in both oil and crop prices.\n\nUnlike the last two recessions \u00d1 earlier this decade and in the early 1990s \u00d1 this one is causing much more job loss among the less educated than among college graduates. Those earlier recessions introduced the country to the concept of mass white-collar layoffs. The brunt of the layoffs in this recession is falling on construction workers, hotel workers, retail workers and others without a four-year degree.\n\nThe Great Recession of 2008 (and beyond) is hurting men more than women. It is hurting homeowners and investors more than renters or retirees who rely on Social Security checks. It is hurting Latinos more than any other ethnic group. A year ago, a greater share of Latinos held jobs than whites. Today, the two have switched places.\n\nIf the Great Recession, as some have called it, has a capital city, it is El Centro, Calif., due east of San Diego, in the desert of California\u00d5s Inland Valley. El Centro has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, a depressionlike 22.6 percent.\n\nIt\u00d5s an agricultural area \u00d1 because of water pumped in from the Colorado River, which allows lettuce, broccoli and the like to grow \u00d1 and unemployment is in double digits even in good times. But El Centro has lately been hit by the brutal combination of a drought, a housing bust and a falling peso, which cuts into the buying power of Mexicans who cross the border to shop.\n\nUntil recently, El Centro was one of those relatively cheap inland California areas where construction and home sales were booming. Today, it is pockmarked with \u00d2bank-owned\u00d3 for sale signs. A wallboard factory in nearby Plaster City \u00d1 its actual name \u00d1 has laid off workers once kept busy by the housing boom. Even Wal-Mart has cut jobs, Sam Couchman, who runs the county\u00d5s work force development office, told me.\n\nYou often hear that recessions exact the biggest price on the most vulnerable workers. And that\u00d5s true about this recession, at least for the moment. But it isn\u00d5t the whole story. Just look at Wall Street, where a generation-long bubble seems to lose a bit more air every day.\n\nIn the long run, this Great Recession may end up afflicting the comfortable more than the afflicted.\n\nThe main reason that recessions tend to increase inequality is that lower-income workers are concentrated in boom-and-bust industries. Agriculture is the classic example. In recent years, construction has become the most important one.\n\nBy the start of this decade, the construction sector employed more men without a college education than the manufacturing sector did, Lawrence Katz, the Harvard labor economist, points out. (As recently as 1980, three times as many such men worked in manufacturing as construction.) The housing boom was like a giant jobs program for many workers who otherwise would have struggled to find decent paying work.\n\nThe housing bust has forced many of them into precisely that struggle and helps explain the recession\u00d5s outsize toll on Latinos and men. In the summer of 2005, just as the real estate market was peaking, I spent a day visiting home construction sites in Frederick, Md., something of a Washington exurb, interviewing the workers. They were almost exclusively Latino.\n\nAt the time, the national unemployment rate for Latino men was 3.6 percent. Today, when there aren\u00d5t many homes being built in Frederick or anywhere else, that unemployment rate is 11 percent. And this number understates the damage, since it excludes a considerable number of immigrants who have returned home.\n\nFrederick was typical of the boom in another way, too. It wasn\u00d5t nearly as affluent as some closer suburbs. Now the bust is widening that gap.\n\nIf you look at the interactive map with this column, you will see the places that already had high unemployment before the recession have also had some of the largest increases. Some are victims of the housing bust, like inland California. Others are manufacturing centers, as in Michigan and North Carolina, whose long-term decline is accelerating. Rhode Island, home to both factories and Boston exurbs, has one of the highest jobless rates in the nation.\n\nAll of these trends will serve to increase inequality. Yet I still think the Great Recession will eventually end up compressing the rungs on the nation\u00d5s economic ladder. Why? For the same three fundamental reasons that the Great Depression did.\n\nThe first is the stock market crash. Clearly, it has hurt wealthy and upper middle-class families, who own the bulk of stock, more than others. In addition, thousands of high-paying Wall Street jobs \u00d1 jobs that have helped the share of income flowing to the top 1 percent of earners soar in recent decades \u00d1 will disappear.\n\nHard as it may be to believe, the crash will also help a lot of young families. The stocks that they buy in coming years are likely to appreciate far more than they would have if the Dow were still above 14,000. The same is true of future house purchases for the one in three families still renting a home.\n\nThe second reason is government policy. The Obama administration plans to raise taxes on the affluent, cut them for everyone else (so long as the government can afford it, that is) and take other steps to reduce inequality. Franklin D. Roosevelt did something similar and it had a huge effect.\n\nOf course, these two factors both boil down to redistribution. One group is benefiting at the expense of another. Yes, many of the people on the losing end of that shift have done quite well in recent years, far better than most Americans. Still, the shift isn\u00d5t making the economic pie any bigger. It is simply being divided differently.\n\nWhich is why the third factor \u00d1 education \u00d1 is the most important of all. It can make the pie larger and divide it more evenly.\n\nThat was the legacy of the great surge in school enrollment during the Great Depression. Teenagers who once would have dropped out to do factory work instead stayed in high school, notes Claudia Goldin, an economist who recently wrote a history of education with Mr. Katz.\n\nIn the manufacturing-heavy mid-Atlantic states, the high school graduation rate was just above 20 percent in the late 1920s. By 1940, it was almost 60 percent. These graduates then became the skilled workers and teachers who helped build the great post-World War II American economy.\n\nNothing would benefit tomorrow\u00d5s economy more than a similar surge. And there is some evidence that it\u00d5s starting to happen. In El Centro, enrollment at Imperial Valley Community College jumped 11 percent this semester. Ed Gould, the college president, said he expected applications to keep rising next year.\n\nUnfortunately, California \u00d1 one of the states hit hardest by the Great Recession \u00d1 is in the midst of a fiscal crisis. So Imperial Valley\u00d5s budget is being capped. Next year, Mr. Gould expects he will have to tell some students that they can\u00d5t take a full load of classes, just when they most need help."}

In Hercules\u00d5s great clash with it, he would cut off one of its heads, only to have two more appear. No matter what he did, he couldn\u00d5t keep up.\n\nYou can think of Congress\u00d5s efforts to pay for health reform as being a little bit like a battle to slay a many-headed Hydra.\n\nMembers of Congress have come up with one idea after another to pay for covering the uninsured. But they still haven\u00d5t put together legislation that could pass. And that\u00d5s in large part because most of those ideas have a basic flaw.\n\nThey do not raise revenue as quickly as health costs rise. The plan to impose a surtax on top earners, for instance, pays a decent chunk of the bill over the next few years. But the revenue from the tax rises only as fast (roughly) as the United States economy grows. The same is true of most taxes.\n\nHealth costs, on the other hand, are growing much more quickly than the economy. Over the last decade, the economy has expanded by about 20 percent, and health spending has ballooned 50 percent. The gap isn\u00d5t about to start closing, either.\n\nSo no matter what Congress has done to pay for its plans, it can\u00d5t keep up.\n\nThe numbers show there is only one sure way out of the problem, and, after months of roundabout discussion, that solution has re-emerged: It\u00d5s a tax on health care.\n\nIf Congress taxes health care, the revenue has a chance of rising with health spending. A health tax will also create an incentive for workers and businesses to slow the growth of health spending \u00d1 thus reducing the amount of taxes needed to pay the nation\u00d5s health bill.\n\nThe health care debate is now in one of those calm-before-the-storm moments. After a flurry of activity last week, everybody is waiting for the Senate Finance Committee to release its bill.\n\nThat bill will immediately become the reference point for all the other big players. Republican leaders will take shots at it, hoping to keep moderate Senate Republicans from supporting it. Conservative Blue Dog Democrats will argue that the bill makes their case for a less expensive plan than the current House version, with less generous subsidies for the uninsured. Liberals will take their own shots at the bill. Most intriguing, President Obama will have to decide whether to make the bill his own.\n\nThe rest of us will want to focus on two questions. How serious is Washington about slowing the soaring the growth in health costs? And will Washington figure out a way to cover most of the uninsured?\n\nAs it happens, there is one policy that can help with both issues. It\u00d5s the same policy that will allow Congress to solve its herculean budget problem: Taxing health care.\n\nIn recent days, the Finance Committee has been considering precisely such a tax, on the health benefits that Americans receive from their employers.\n\nThe fact that these benefits are not taxed, as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber notes, stems from \u00d2nothing more than an arbitrary administrative decision made 60 years ago.\u00d3 Unfortunately, that decision created all kinds of economic damage. Because health care \u00d1 unlike food, clothing and most other things \u00d1 isn\u00d5t taxed, it\u00d5s effectively on sale. And when something is on sale, people often buy more of it than they need.\n\nIn the case of health care, they buy \u00d1 or their employer buys for them \u00d1 insurance plans that don\u00d5t make much of an effort to control costs. Rather than putting pressure on hospitals to root out administrative waste, the plans cover the cost of that waste. They also cover the costs of brand-name drugs that are no more effective than generic alternatives and other kinds of expensive care that do little to improve health.\n\nAs a result, the tax exclusion ultimately raises your tax bill, via wasteful Medicare spending. Indeed, if there is a single health care idea on which liberal and conservatives agree \u00d1 including Douglas Elmendorf, director of the influential Congressional Budget Office \u00d1 it\u00d5s scrapping the exclusion.\n\nYet many politicians are loath to come out against the exclusion, for the obvious reason that it makes them sound pro-tax. The Blue Dogs may be the best example. They have rightly pushed House leaders to be tougher about holding down cost growth. But most Blue Dogs have not been willing to get specific, on the tax exclusion or most everything else.\n\nTo deal with this political reality, the Senate Finance Committee has become intrigued by a version of a health care tax, being pushed by the Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry, that comes dressed up with a whole lot of lipstick. The tax doesn\u00d5t fall directly on workers. It doesn\u00d5t even fall on employers. It falls on everyone\u00d5s favorite villain: health insurance companies.\n\nInsurers that offered policies that cost more than a certain amount \u00d1 perhaps $25,000 a year \u00d1 would face a tax. The resulting tax revenue would help pay for covering the uninsured. Presumably, insurers would pass the cost of the tax onto companies, which would then become less willing to offer expensive plans. They would instead shift some of the money they are now spending on health insurance into cash compensation, which would, of course, be taxed, raising more revenue.\n\nBut packaging the plan as a tax on insurers still may not be enough to make it palatable. So Congress would also probably have it apply only to the most expensive sliver of plans. David Axelrod, the Obama adviser, recently mentioned the $40,000 plans at Goldman Sachs (a firm that is now apparently about as popular as health insurers).\n\nWith this narrow approach, the tax would raise only a small share of the revenue needed to cover the uninsured, and Congress would still need to rely on a hodgepodge of other tax increases and spending cuts. But starting to lift the exclusion would still help \u00d1 especially if Congress set the threshold for the tax to rise more slowly than health costs have been rising. That way, more and more of the most expensive, least efficient plans would eventually be bumping up against the tax.\n\nFor all the budgetary elegance of the tax, though, its real importance is much larger. It would begin to chip away at the perverse incentives in our medical system.\n\nThat\u00d5s what matters. The idea isn\u00d5t to punish Goldman traders or, for that matter, unionized workers who have their own generous plans. The idea is to give companies and workers more incentive to choose medical plans that try to reduce unnecessary costs. Without that incentive, is there any wonder our health care system is so troubled?\n\nThis brings us back \u00d1 and you knew this was coming, didn\u00d5t you? \u00d1 to the many-headed Hydra. Eventually, Hercules realized his strategy wasn\u00d5t working. So he brought in his nephew, Iolaus, who torched the open wounds that Hercules inflicted on the Hydra, preventing any new heads from growing. And that worked. Hercules and Iolaus slew the beast.\n\nHow did they do it? By getting at the root of the problem."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " Ben Bernanke sounded more optimistic on Tuesday than he has in a long time, and President Obama has talked about glimmers of hope. The stock market has risen 34 percent from its 2009 nadir.\n\nOn Friday morning, we will get the clearest sign yet of whether these glimmers are real. That\u00d5s when the Labor Department will release its monthly jobs report, the single most important economic indicator out there. As bad as the job market is, it no longer seems to be getting worse at an accelerating pace. In both February and March, the economy lost fewer than 670,000 jobs; in January, it had lost 741,000.\n\nIn past recessions, a slowdown in the rate of job loss has been a telling sign. A few months after that, the economy typically began growing again. The vicious cycle turned virtuous.\n\nAfter a stretch of unrelenting bad news, dating to last year, the economic signals have been more mixed lately. In just the last week, data on home sales, manufacturing and the service sector have all been better than expected. This welcome news has caused many of us who are pessimistic about the economy\u00d5s near-term fortunes to reassess.\n\n\u00d2At the moment,\u00d3 says Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR, a New York research firm, \u00d2those forecasting nearer-term recovery have the recent data on their side.\u00d3\n\nThere is still a strong case to be made that the economy won\u00d5t feel truly healthy anytime soon, not this year or perhaps even next.\n\nThe overhang from the 20-year bubble in stocks and then real estate won\u00d5t simply go away. As Mr. Shapiro says, \u00d2Wage and salary growth has evaporated, credit is very tight, home prices continue to decline, financial asset values have been decimated and household balance sheets are extremely stressed.\u00d3\n\nBut the difference between a bad economy and a depression is real. We\u00d5ve taken a few steps away from depression lately. If Friday\u00d5s jobs report shows more progress, it will suggest that Mr. Bernanke\u00d5s optimism is legitimate.\n\nWall Street has a notoriously bad forecasting record. It almost always predicts that the economy will grow by something like 3 percent a year, which happens to be correct most of the time. But when a forecast would most be useful \u00d1 when the economy is turning \u00d1 Wall Street doesn\u00d5t offer much guidance. Amazingly enough, Wall Street\u00d5s consensus forecast has failed to predict a single recession in the last 30 years.\n\nA small firm in New York called the Economic Cycle Research Institute has a much better record. It was founded by Geoffrey Moore, an economist who helped invent the idea of leading indicators. He used historical patterns to predict the economy\u00d5s direction, and unlike most Wall Street forecasters, he wasn\u00d5t afraid to stand apart from the crowd. In 2006, while most forecasters were still talking about 3 percent growth, Mr. Moore\u00d5s prot\u008eg\u008es were issuing warnings (though they were still too optimistic).\n\nToday, they think the economy is on the verge of turning. \u00d2We\u00d5re in the worst recession since World War II,\u00d3 says Lakshman Achuthan, the managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute. \u00d2However, the days of this recession are limited.\u00d3\n\nThe main reason, he says, is the economy\u00d5s normal self-correcting mechanism. That mechanism, I realize, is somewhat counterintuitive. You often hear \u00d1 and we in the news media often write \u00d1 about the vicious cycle of job cuts, spending cuts and yet more job cuts. Eventually, though, the cycle always ends, and momentum reverses.\n\nHow? Prices fall by enough to tempt households to spend. Businesses cut their costs, become profitable again, and begin to expand. Spending begets more spending. This is what\u00d5s happening now, Mr. Achuthan argues. The stimulus plan is also making a difference, he says, and so are the government\u00d5s efforts to reduce the cost of borrowing.\n\nObama administration officials have been a bit more circumspect. They have said, as you would expect them to, that more disappointments are likely. But Lawrence Summers, the top economic adviser, has also been talking lately about the economy\u00d5s tendency to self-correct.\n\nTo replace worn-out vehicles and accommodate a growing population, Americans need to buy roughly 14 million vehicles a year, Mr. Summers says. Recently, they have been selling at an annual pace of only nine million. At some point, more people will have to start buying.\n\nThe Economic Cycle Research Institute\u00d5s data show that, in every previous downturn in the last 75 years, the economy has started to grow no more than four months after its pace of deterioration has unquestionably slowed. So that\u00d5s what the institute is forecasting: the Great Recession will most likely be over by Labor Day.\n\nFriday\u00d5s jobs report, covering April, will support this case if, at the very least, it shows job losses of no more than 650,000 a month. The average forecast among economists is roughly 610,000. The Labor Department\u00d5s revisions to its February and March numbers will also be worth watching.\n\nStill, even most optimists, including Mr. Achuthan, are not predicting a fabulous recovery. The forces weighing on the economy are too strong.\n\nStock prices, despite their dizzying fall, are only slightly below their historical average, relative to long-term earnings, which suggests that a true bull market is unlikely. Home prices still have some way to fall. Eventually, the government will need to bring down the budget deficit, and doing so will hold back economic growth.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u00d5s economists put out a thoughtful report this week, pointing out that the aggressive steps taken by the government have so far muted the impact of \u00d2deleveraging\u00d3 \u00d1 the paying down of debt by households and Wall Street. But this debt repayment is still happening, and it will be a drag on growth for a long time. The debt and the severity of this recession also raise the risk that the recent signs will turn out to be a false dawn, much as the economy slipped back into a deep downturn in the mid-1930s.\n\nAnd whenever the economy begins growing again, it won\u00d5t feel good for a while. Slowing job losses aren\u00d5t the same as job gains. The unemployment rate may continue to rise into 2010 \u00d1 and not come down to a healthy level until even later.\n\nAs a point of reference, the recession of the early 1990s ended in March 1991, but Americans were still so dissatisfied that they removed George H. W. Bush from office a year and a half later.\n\nSo the situation is not as dark as it was a few months ago. Maybe Friday\u00d5s jobs report will bring more reason for hope. But the Great Recession, or at least its impact, still has a way to go."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " Sixteen years ago, two economists published a research paper with a delightfully simple title: \u00d2Looting.\u00d3\n\nThe economists were George Akerlof, who would later win a Nobel Prize, and Paul Romer, the renowned expert on economic growth. In the paper, they argued that several financial crises in the 1980s, like the Texas real estate bust, had been the result of private investors taking advantage of the government. The investors had borrowed huge amounts of money, made big profits when times were good and then left the government holding the bag for their eventual (and predictable) losses.\n\nIn a word, the investors looted. Someone trying to make an honest profit, Professors Akerlof and Romer said, would have operated in a completely different manner. The investors displayed a \u00d2total disregard for even the most basic principles of lending,\u00d3 failing to verify standard information about their borrowers or, in some cases, even to ask for that information.\n\nThe investors \u00d2acted as if future losses were somebody else\u00d5s problem,\u00d3 the economists wrote. \u00d2They were right.\u00d3\n\nOn Tuesday morning in Washington, Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave a speech that read like a sad coda to the \u00d2Looting\u00d3 paper. Because the government is unwilling to let big, interconnected financial firms fail \u00d1 and because people at those firms knew it \u00d1 they engaged in what Mr. Bernanke called \u00d2excessive risk-taking.\u00d3 To prevent such problems in the future, he called for tougher regulation.\n\nNow, it would have been nice if the Fed had shown some of this regulatory zeal before the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But that day has passed. So people are rightly starting to think about building a new, less vulnerable financial system.\n\nAnd \u00d2Looting\u00d3 provides a really useful framework. The paper\u00d5s message is that the promise of government bailouts isn\u00d5t merely one aspect of the problem. It is the core problem.\n\nPromised bailouts mean that anyone lending money to Wall Street \u00d1 ranging from small-time savers like you and me to the Chinese government \u00d1 doesn\u00d5t have to worry about losing that money. The United States Treasury (which, in the end, is also you and me) will cover the losses. In fact, it has to cover the losses, to prevent a cascade of worldwide losses and panic that would make today\u00d5s crisis look tame.\n\nBut the knowledge among lenders that their money will ultimately be returned, no matter what, clearly brings a terrible downside. It keeps the lenders from asking tough questions about how their money is being used. Looters \u00d1 savings and loans and Texas developers in the 1980s; the American International Group, Citigroup, Fannie Mae and the rest in this decade \u00d1 can then act as if their future losses are indeed somebody else\u00d5s problem.\n\nDo you remember the mea culpa that Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke\u00d5s predecessor, delivered on Capitol Hill last fall? He said that he was \u00d2in a state of shocked disbelief\u00d3 that \u00d2the self-interest\u00d3 of Wall Street bankers hadn\u00d5t prevented this mess.\n\nHe shouldn\u00d5t have been. The looting theory explains why his laissez-faire theory didn\u00d5t hold up. The bankers were acting in their self-interest, after all.\n\nThe term that\u00d5s used to describe this general problem, of course, is moral hazard. When people are protected from the consequences of risky behavior, they behave in a pretty risky fashion. Bankers can make long-shot investments, knowing that they will keep the profits if they succeed, while the taxpayers will cover the losses.\n\nThis form of moral hazard \u00d1 when profits are privatized and losses are socialized \u00d1 certainly played a role in creating the current mess. But when I spoke with Mr. Romer on Tuesday, he was careful to make a distinction between classic moral hazard and looting. It\u00d5s an important distinction.\n\nWith moral hazard, bankers are making real wagers. If those wagers pay off, the government has no role in the transaction. With looting, the government\u00d5s involvement is crucial to the whole enterprise.\n\nThink about the so-called liars\u00d5 loans from recent years: like those Texas real estate loans from the 1980s, they never had a chance of paying off. Sure, they would deliver big profits for a while, so long as the bubble kept inflating. But when they inevitably imploded, the losses would overwhelm the gains. As Gretchen Morgenson has reported, Merrill Lynch\u00d5s losses from the last two years wiped out its profits from the previous decade.\n\nWhat happened? Banks borrowed money from lenders around the world. The bankers then kept a big chunk of that money for themselves, calling it \u00d2management fees\u00d3 or \u00d2performance bonuses.\u00d3 Once the investments were exposed as hopeless, the lenders \u00d1 ordinary savers, foreign countries, other banks, you name it \u00d1 were repaid with government bailouts.\n\nIn effect, the bankers had siphoned off this bailout money in advance, years before the government had spent it.\n\nI understand this chain of events sounds a bit like a conspiracy. And in some cases, it surely was. Some A.I.G. employees, to take one example, had to have understood what their credit derivative division in London was doing. But more innocent optimism probably played a role, too. The human mind has a tremendous ability to rationalize, and the possibility of making millions of dollars invites some hard-core rationalization.\n\nEither way, the bottom line is the same: given an incentive to loot, Wall Street did so. \u00d2If you think of the financial system as a whole,\u00d3 Mr. Romer said, \u00d2it actually has an incentive to trigger the rare occasions in which tens or hundreds of billions of dollars come flowing out of the Treasury.\u00d3\n\nUnfortunately, we can\u00d5t very well stop the flow of that money now. The bankers have already walked away with their profits (though many more of them deserve a subpoena to a Congressional hearing room). Allowing A.I.G. to collapse, out of spite, could cause a financial shock bigger than the one that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Modern economies can\u00d5t function without credit, which means the financial system needs to be bailed out.\n\nBut the future also requires the kind of overhaul that Mr. Bernanke has begun to sketch out. Firms will have to be monitored much more seriously than they were during the Greenspan era. They can\u00d5t be allowed to shop around for the regulatory agency that least understands what they\u00d5re doing. The biggest Wall Street paydays should be held in escrow until it\u00d5s clear they weren\u00d5t based on fictional profits.\n\nAbove all, as Mr. Romer says, the federal government needs the power and the will to take over a firm as soon as its potential losses exceed its assets. Anything short of that is an invitation to loot.\n\nMr. Bernanke actually took a step in this direction on Tuesday. He said the government \u00d2needs improved tools to allow the orderly resolution of a systemically important nonbank financial firm.\u00d3 In layman\u00d5s terms, he was asking for a clearer legal path to nationalization.\n\nAt a time like this, when trust in financial markets is so scant, it may be hard to imagine that looting will ever be a problem again. But it will be. If we don\u00d5t get rid of the incentive to loot, the only question is what form the next round of looting will take.\n\nMr. Akerlof and Mr. Romer finished writing their paper in the early 1990s, when the economy was still suffering a hangover from the excesses of the 1980s. But Mr. Akerlof told Mr. Romer \u00d1 a skeptical Mr. Romer, as he acknowledged with a laugh on Tuesday \u00d1 that the next candidate for looting already seemed to be taking shape.\n\nIt was an obscure little market called credit derivatives."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " Every so often, history serves up an analogy that\u00d5s uncomfortable, a little distracting and yet still very relevant.\n\nThe French delegation to the global economic conference in London in 1933 during the Depression. Little came of the meeting, which adjourned in six weeks with no major agreements.\n\nIn the summer of 1933, just as they will do on Thursday, heads of government and their finance ministers met in London to talk about a global economic crisis. They accomplished little and went home to battle the crisis in their own ways.\n\nMore than any other country, Germany \u00d1 Nazi Germany \u00d1 then set out on a serious stimulus program. The government built up the military, expanded the autobahn, put up stadiums for the 1936 Berlin Olympics and built monuments to the Nazi Party across Munich and Berlin.\n\nThe economic benefits of this vast works program never flowed to most workers, because fascism doesn\u00d5t look kindly on collective bargaining. But Germany did escape the Great Depression faster than other countries. Corporate profits boomed, and unemployment sank (and not because of slave labor, which didn\u00d5t become widespread until later). Harold James, an economic historian, says that the young liberal economists studying under John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s began to debate whether Hitler had solved unemployment.\n\nNo sane person enjoys mixing nuance and Nazis, but this bit of economic history has a particular importance this week. In the run-up to the G-20 meeting, European leaders have resisted calls for more government spending. Last week, the European Union president, Mirek Topolanek, echoed a line from AC/DC \u00d1 whom he had just heard in concert \u00d1 and described the Obama administration\u00d5s stimulus plan as \u00d2a road to hell.\u00d3\n\nHere in the United States, many people are understandably wondering whether the $800 billion stimulus program will make much of a difference. They want to know: Does stimulus work? Fortunately, this is one economic question that\u00d5s been answered pretty clearly in the last century.\n\nYes, stimulus works.\n\nWhen governments have taken aggressive steps to soften an economic decline, they have succeeded. The Germans did it in the 1930s. Franklin D. Roosevelt did so more haltingly, and had more halting results. Even the limp Japanese recovery plan of the 1990s makes the case. Although dithering over a bank rescue kept Japan in a slump, government spending on roads and bridges made things better than they otherwise would have been.\n\nNo matter what happens in London on Thursday, President Obama and other world leaders are sure to claim the meeting as a success. (\u00d2I do not regard the economic conference as a failure,\u00d3 Roosevelt said in 1933.)\n\nBut if the meeting is going to be an actual success, it will have to do more than put a happy face on trans-Atlantic disagreements. It will need to begin nudging the discussion about stimulus toward a more accurate reading of history.\n\nThe Americans and Europeans aren\u00d5t really as far apart as Mr. Topolanek\u00d5s AC/DC homage suggests. Europe is doing less than the United States, but the gap isn\u00d5t huge. It just seems so because European stimulus tends to arrive quietly, from existing safety net programs. In this country, where the safety net is weaker, stimulus comes largely from new laws.\n\nYet the rhetoric from Europe \u00d1 even the more subdued recent remarks, like those of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany \u00d1 still creates a problem. Stimulus skepticism today will make it harder to pass more stimulus tomorrow. And more will probably be needed.\n\nGeorge Soros, the billionaire investor who was born in Budapest and works in New York, came to Washington last week and captured both the problem and the potential for a solution. \u00d2I think they can be brought around,\u00d3 he said of the Europeans. \u00d2I am actually hopeful something constructive can happen.\u00d3\n\nThe objections to stimulus tend to come in two forms: Its costs are too high, and its benefits too small.\n\nMr. Topolanek and German officials have been pressing the first argument. They say that the additional government spending can lead to inflation and government debt. The Weimar Republic of the 1920s, where inflation helped lead to Hitler\u00d5s rise, casts a long shadow.\n\nStimulus opponents here in the United States \u00d1 mainly Congressional Republicans (though not, tellingly, Republican governors of some large states) \u00d1 have been warning about debt, too. But they have also been making the second argument. When the government spends money, they say, it simply displaces spending by the private sector. Republicans on Capitol Hill have taken to citing a recent book by the journalist Amity Shlaes, \u00d2The Forgotten Man,\u00d3 which claims the New Deal didn\u00d5t work.\n\nTheoretically, neither of these arguments is crazy. But they don\u00d5t have much evidence on their side.\n\nThe best takedown of Ms. Shlaes\u00d5s thesis came from Eric Rauchway, a historian, who pointed out that her favorite statistic did not count people employed by New Deal programs to be employed. Excluding the effects of the medicine, the patient is as sick as ever!\n\nWhen Roosevelt stuck to a stimulus program, unemployment fell markedly, and the biggest stimulus of all \u00d1 World War II \u00d1 did the rest. It\u00d5s true that economic models say the economy shouldn\u00d5t work this way. When resources are sitting idle, businesses should find a way to use them profitably. But they often don\u00d5t.\n\nPeople become irrationally pessimistic during a downturn. They are driven by what Keynes called animal spirits. Only government can typically change the dynamic.\n\nCould the government spending eventually lead to inflation and crippling debts? Absolutely. But the mistakes of the last 80 years have gone in the other direction. During the Great Depression, Japan\u00d5s lost decade, the Asian financial crisis and even the last 18 months, governments didn\u00d5t act aggressively enough. Deflation and lack of growth ended up being the real risks.\n\nThese are precisely the risks facing the world economy now. In Spain, prices are already falling. Layoffs are still mounting around the world. Financial firms have more losses to acknowledge.\n\nGiven the diminished standing of the United States, Mr. Obama won\u00d5t be able to get the Europeans to fall in line behind him this week. But he can still make progress. He and the American delegation can, in gentle terms, ask the Europeans to live up to their own standard \u00d1 and remind them of their self-interest.\n\nTwo weeks ago, responding to criticism, an executive of the European Central Bank wrote a letter to an Italian newspaper claiming, \u00d2fiscal stimulus in European countries is wholly comparable to that seen in the United States.\u00d3 That simply isn\u00d5t true, as the chart at right makes clear. The difference amounts to about $200 billion over three years.\n\nBecause the global economy is in many ways integrated, Europe can benefit from American stimulus without pulling its own weight. But because the global economy isn\u00d5t completely integrated, European stimulus would still help Europe more than anywhere else. And that presents the American delegation with perhaps its most persuasive case.\n\nRight now, Eastern Europe appears to be one of the world\u00d5s most vulnerable places. It is a relatively poor region, where the population is disaffected and where the economy is shrinking rapidly. In both Estonia and Latvia, the gross domestic product fell 10 percent last year.\n\nAt the G-20, the leaders of the richer European countries will be asking the world to help Eastern Europe. By all means, the world should help. But Europe should reconsider its part, too."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " The big debate about President Obama\u00d5s financial rescue plan has centered on whether he\u00d5s been right to avoid nationalizing the country\u00d5s biggest banks. But there is another, more pressing question about the plan that has received considerably less attention.\n\nAfter the Federal Reserve\u00d5s stress tests identify the country\u00d5s sickest banks next week, who will bear responsibility for shoring up their balance sheets?\n\nWill it be solely the government? Or will the government force institutions that lent money to sick banks in better times \u00d1 their creditors \u00d1 to take a hit by forgiving some of the loans?\n\nTimothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and other officials are reluctant to force losses, often called haircuts, on banks. They worry that haircuts could create a cascade, in which some of the creditors that take losses become insolvent, while creditors of healthier banks begin wondering whether they will be subject to future haircuts. In the ensuing panic, financial markets could freeze up, as they did last fall.\n\nBut relying on the government alone to shore up the banks brings risks, too. In the long term, it could leave taxpayers with an enormous bill. In the short term, it could destroy the already thin political support for the rescue plan.\n\nRecently \u00d1 and, I\u00d5d argue, fortunately \u00d1 the Obama administration seems to have become more open to the idea of encouraging loan forgiveness in certain situations. Beyond those situations, officials hope that no others are needed.\n\nYet that may turn out to be wishful thinking. The Treasury Department has only about $130 billion remaining in its Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, fund. By comparison, American banks are probably facing an additional $1 trillion in losses over the next two years, the International Monetary Fund projects.\n\nThe gap between those numbers means that the debate over haircuts could be with us for a while.\n\nThe case against haircuts starts with Lehman Brothers. When Lehman collapsed into bankruptcy on the night of Sept. 14, its creditors were left with billions of dollars in loans to Lehman they would never recover. Needing to conserve capital and fearful that other firms might collapse soon, they largely stopped lending.\n\n\u00d2That\u00d5s when this crisis took a quantum leap up in terms of seriousness,\u00d3 as Janet Yellen, the president of the San Francisco Fed, recently said.\n\nSo imagine that on Monday, when releasing the results of its stress tests, the Fed says that several banks need more money to survive a deep recession. Assuming private investors are not willing to put it up, the government will then have two options.\n\nIt can increase the banks\u00d5 assets, by giving them more taxpayer money in exchange for an even greater ownership stake. Or the government can reduce the banks\u00d5 debts, by using its influence to encourage, or even demand, loan forgiveness.\n\nDebt reduction, in exchange for an equity stake, is a standard strategy for dealing with failing companies. It\u00d5s what the Obama administration is trying to do with Chrysler\u00d5s and G.M.\u00d5s creditors. Under the tentative deal worked out on Tuesday, Chrysler\u00d5s creditors would receive about 28 cents in stock for every dollar of loans they forgave.\n\nBut banks aren\u00d5t like other companies. Like it or not, they are the heart of the credit system and thus the economy. No matter what happens to Chrysler\u00d5s creditors, Honda won\u00d5t stop making cars, and people won\u00d5t stop buying them. Imposing losses on Bank of America\u00d5s creditors, though, has the potential to freeze the financial markets.\n\nOne sign that such concerns are legitimate is the fact that they\u00d5re shared by some economists who saw the financial crisis coming well before Fed officials or Mr. Obama\u00d5s current advisers. At a Fed conference in 2005, Raghuram Rajan \u00d1 then the director of research at the I.M.F. and now a University of Chicago professor \u00d1 criticized Alan Greenspan for turning a blind eye to risk (and was in turn criticized by Lawrence H. Summers, now Mr. Obama\u00d5s lead economic adviser). Today, Mr. Rajan says that haircuts really do have the potential to make some financial firms insolvent and cause worldwide problems.\n\nYet he also says that the government should study whether it can sensibly impose any losses on creditors, rather than unquestioningly accepting Wall Street\u00d5s self-interested view that haircuts would be bad for the economy. \u00d2We constantly have to question the arguments the Street puts forward,\u00d3 he said, \u00d2and ask whether they are really these holy cows who can\u00d5t be touched.\u00d3\n\nEver so gradually, the administration may be moving toward this more skeptical position.\n\nIn February, the Treasury began twisting the arms of some holders of Citigroup preferred stock to get them to convert it into common stock. (Preferred stock, despite its name, is something between a loan and stock.) The credit markets hiccupped, but quickly returned to their previous state. In the wake of the stress tests, the Fed and the administration may well push for more conversions along these lines.\n\nThe trickier issue is what to do with holders of so-called subordinate debt. In the spectrum of investments, subordinate debt is considered safer than preferred stock and tends to be subject to haircuts only when a company slides toward bankruptcy. Pushing a bank to the brink of bankruptcy would raise the specter of Lehman Brothers.\n\nNow, some debtholders may be fearful enough of bankruptcy that they would willingly accept haircuts, figuring they are better than the alternative. On \u00d2Meet the Press\u00d3 on April 19, Mr. Summers said one option for increasing the banks\u00d5 capital was \u00d2asset liability swaps,\u00d3 by which he meant a voluntary exchange of loan forgiveness for equity.\n\nThe government\u00d5s main role would be to force existing equity holders to offer the swaps to creditors. Equity holders often oppose such swaps because their own stake is diluted. But government regulators could insist that the offer be made and then allow debtholders to accept or reject it. If the offer were, say, 60 cents on the dollar and the market price of the debt only 50 cents, the creditors might accept.\n\nIf steps like these, along with TARP, are enough to repair the financial system, haircuts won\u00d5t be needed. If not, the only remaining options will be more taxpayer money, more haircuts or both.\n\nWe already know what the bankers will say about haircuts, regardless of how carefully they\u00d5re devised: that they\u00d5ll end up hurting the rest of us. Remember, though, they said the same thing about stronger financial regulation, and they turned out to be spectacularly wrong. Stronger regulation would indeed have hurt many bankers. It would have benefited the rest of us.\n\nThis month, I interviewed Mr. Obama for a Q. and A. to be published Sunday in The New York Times Magazine, and I asked him why his economic inner circle was dominated by prot\u008eg\u008es of Robert Rubin. These prot\u008eg\u008es, like Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers, are deeply thoughtful people, just as Mr. Rubin is. But in retrospect, they all gave too much deference to Wall Street.\n\nMr. Obama replied that his economic team also included people from outside the Rubin circle, which is certainly true. Still, Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers remain the dominant forces in the team.\n\nWhen they \u00d1 and the president \u00d1 consider Wall Street\u00d5s warnings about haircuts, I hope they also consider its track record. Lately, taxpayers haven\u00d5t done very well when they\u00d5ve listened to Wall Street\u00d5s advice. "}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": "The budget that President Obama proposed on Thursday is nothing less than an attempt to end a three-decade era of economic policy dominated by the ideas of Ronald Reagan and his supporters.\n\nThe Obama budget \u00d1 a bold, even radical departure from recent history, wrapped in bureaucratic formality and statistical tables \u00d1 would sharply raise taxes on the rich, beyond where Bill Clinton had raised them. It would reduce taxes for everyone else, to a lower point than they were under either Mr. Clinton or George W. Bush. And it would lay the groundwork for sweeping changes in health care and education, among other areas.\n\nMore than anything else, the proposals seek to reverse the rapid increase in economic inequality over the last 30 years. They do so first by rewriting the tax code and, over the longer term, by trying to solve some big causes of the middle-class income slowdown, like high medical costs and slowing educational gains.\n\nAfter Mr. Obama spent much of his first five weeks in office responding to the financial crisis, his budget effectively tried to reclaim momentum for the priorities on which he campaigned.\n\nHis efforts would add to a budget deficit already swollen by Mr. Bush\u00d5s policies and the recession, creating the largest deficit, relative to the size of the economy, since World War II. Erasing that deficit will require some tough choices \u00d1 about further spending cuts and tax increases \u00d1 that Mr. Obama avoided this week.\n\nBut he nonetheless made choices.\n\nHe sought to eliminate some corporate subsidies, for health insurers, banks and agricultural companies, that economists have long criticized. He proposed putting a price on carbon, to slow global warming, and then refunding most of the revenue from that program through broad-based tax cuts. He called for roughly $100 billion a year in tax increases on the wealthy \u00d1 mostly delayed until 2011, when the recession will presumably have ended \u00d1 and $50 billion a year in net tax cuts for the nonwealthy.\n\nThe history of the United States economy over the last 70 years can be roughly divided into two periods: the decades immediately after World War II, when inequality plummeted, and the past three decades, when global economic forces and government policies caused it to soar. Mr. Obama is setting out to begin a third period that looks more like the first than the second.\n\nThat agenda starts with taxes. Over the last three decades, the pretax incomes of the wealthiest households have risen far more than they have for other households, while the tax rates for top earners have fallen more than they have for others, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nAs a result, the average post-tax income of the top 1 percent of households has jumped by roughly $1 million since 1979, adjusted for inflation, to $1.4 million. Pay for most families has risen only slightly faster than inflation.\n\nBefore becoming Mr. Obama\u00d5s top economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers liked to tell a hypothetical story to distill the trend. The increase in inequality, Mr. Summers would say, meant that each family in the bottom 80 percent of the income distribution was effectively sending a $10,000 check, every year, to the top 1 percent of earners.\n\nMr. Obama\u00d5s budget reflects that sensibility. Budget experts were still sorting through the details on Thursday, but it appeared that various tax cuts and credits aimed at the middle class and the poor would increase the take-home pay of the median household by roughly $800.\n\nThe tax increases on the top 1 percent, meanwhile, will most likely cost them $100,000 a year.\n\n\u00d2The tax code will become more progressive, with relatively higher rates on the rich and relatively lower rates on the middle class and poor,\u00d3 said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center in Washington. \u00d2This is reversing the effects of the Bush policies,\u00d3 he added, and then going even further.\n\nAnd just as Franklin D. Roosevelt\u00d5s tax increases on the wealthy followed a stock market crash, which had already depressed their incomes, Mr. Obama\u00d5s proposals \u00d1 if they become law \u00d1 would too. The combination has the potential to reverse a significant portion of the inequality trends of the last few decades.\n\nBut for the country to repeat the post-World War II pattern, the incomes of most families would also have to begin rising at a faster rate than they have since the 1970s. That outcome remains deeply uncertain. Economists who study economic growth say the American economy is unlikely to grow nearly as fast in coming years as in the 1950s and \u00d560s.\n\nMr. Obama would try to lift the incomes of the middle class and poor through two main channels, administration officials said. The first is an overhaul of health care, meant to reduce the insurance premiums now taking a large bite out of many families\u00d5 paychecks.\n\nThe details remain vague, but the budget begins paying for investments that would eventually allow Medicare officials to refuse to pay for medical treatment that does not show evidence of improving health. If successful, that change would vastly reduce the government\u00d5s long-term budget deficit. It is also likely to bring down private health costs, since insurers typically follow Medicare\u00d5s lead.\n\nThe other channel is education. Over the last three decades, the pay of college graduates has risen significantly faster than the pay of less-educated workers. Mr. Obama aims to move workers into the first category by increasing federal financial aid and simplifying the myriad of aid programs. In recent years, the United States has lost its standing as the country in which the largest share of young adults graduates from college.\n\n\u00d2Low- and middle-income kids often don\u00d5t aspire to college,\u00d3 Peter Orszag, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Thursday. \u00d2They hear \u00d4$40,000 tuition\u00d5 and think that\u00d5s impossible.\u00d3\n\nThere are still many outstanding questions about Mr. Obama\u00d5s efforts, starting with whether Congress will pass a budget that looks anything like his.\n\nHis proposals on health care are likely to meet stiff opposition from some doctors and insurers. Spending more money on financial aid \u00d1 absent other changes to the education system \u00d1 may not lift the graduation rate very much. And if the economy remains weak into next year, as many forecasters expect, Congressional Republicans will try to pin the blame on the looming tax increases on the affluent.\n\nWhatever happens, though, it has been a long time since any president has tried to use his budget to shape the government and the economy quite as much as Mr. Obama did on Thursday. On that score, he and President Reagan have something in common."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": "Ah, retention pay. It has been one of the great rationales for showering money on chief executives and bankers regardless of how well they are doing their jobs. It\u00d5s just that the specific rationale keeps changing.\n\nIn the booming 1990s, companies supposedly had to pay retention bonuses because executives had so many other job opportunities. There was a war raging \u00d1 a war for talent, said McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.\n\nThen came the aftermath of Enron, when new scrutiny and regulations apparently made some chief executives wonder if they still wanted their jobs. \u00d2I\u00d5m thinking of actually getting out,\u00d3 David D\u00d5Alessandro, the head of John Hancock Financial Services, reported hearing from one fellow chief executive. The antidote to such doubts? Retention pay, obviously.\n\nNow comes Mr. Liddy, the government-appointed chief of A.I.G., defending multimillion-dollar bonus payments for the people who run the small division that brought down the company. If the government doesn\u00d5t let them have their money, they will walk away, Mr. Liddy says, and nobody else will know how to clean up their mess.\n\nWe\u00d5ll get to the merits of his argument in a moment, but it\u00d5s first worth considering the damage that the current system of corporate pay has wrought. The potential windfalls were so large that executives and bankers had an incentive to create rules that would reward them no matter what. The country is now living with the consequences.\n\nSo any attempt to build a new financial system, one that\u00d5s less susceptible to bubble, bust and bailout, will have to include a new approach to pay. Yes, the issue is thorny. Some past attempts to rein in pay have ended up being feckless or even counterproductive. But that is no reason to give up.\n\nNothing highlights the fiction of performance-based pay quite so well as retention bonuses. It turns out that, at least for chief executives, retention bonuses are almost entirely unnecessary.\n\nA few years ago, when the economy was still expanding, I looked into every large company that had changed chief executives over the previous six months. Not a single boss at any of them had left for another job. Such departures are so rare that Booz & Company\u00d5s annual study of executive turnover doesn\u00d5t even include a category for them. The benefits of the job \u00d1 the pay, the perks, the gratification that comes from running a company well \u00d1 are too good to leave, even for a similar job.\n\nThe situation is a little different for jobs below the top level, particularly on Wall Street. Surely, if the employees of A.I.G.\u00d5s notorious financial products division were to be denied their bonuses \u00d1 a big chunk of their annual compensation \u00d1 many might leave.\n\nThe nub of Mr. Liddy\u00d5s argument is that these departures would be a terrible thing. But there are several weaknesses with this argument.\n\nThe first is that the original explanation for these bonuses was rather different. When they were devised in early 2008, months before the first bailout, as Mr. Liddy\u00d5s letter to the government on Saturday explained, \u00d2A.I.G. Financial Products was expected to have a significant, ongoing role at A.I.G.\u00d3 The idea, he said, was to guarantee \u00d2a minimum level of pay for both 2008 and 2009.\u00d3 So the rationale for A.I.G.\u00d5s retention bonuses is as malleable as the rationale for chief executives\u00d5 bonuses.\n\nMost amazingly, the A.I.G. bonuses haven\u00d5t even accomplished their stated goal. Andrew Cuomo, New York\u00d5s attorney general, said Tuesday that 52 employees who received bonuses had since left A.I.G.\n\nThe second problem with Mr. Liddy\u00d5s argument has to do with Mr. Liddy himself. His defenders have noted that the government brought him out of retirement to fix A.I.G. and that he presumably puts a higher priority on doing a good job than pleasing A.I.G.\u00d5s employees.\n\nAnd he probably does. But he is also a product of the current, broken executive pay system. As the chairman of Allstate from 1999 to 2007, when the company\u00d5s stock underperformed those of its rivals, he made $137 million. Almost $14 million of that, according to the Corporate Library, came in the form of stock that the company called a \u00d2a tool for retaining executive talent.\u00d3 Which means Mr. Liddy may not be entirely objective about retention bonuses.\n\nFinally, there is the question of how hard replacing those A.I.G. employees would be. Certainly, some of them must have particular insight into unwinding the toxic portfolio they built. But I doubt that anywhere near all 418 financial products employees \u00d1 who have received bonuses worth $395,000 on average \u00d1 are indispensable.\n\nSimon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, has pointed out that in financial crises, bankers often exaggerate the difficulty of cleaning up their mess. They do so partly to justify their own continued importance and also to fight off calls for a government takeover of banks. In reality, Mr. Johnson says, the mechanics of cleaning up hobbled banks turned out to be fairly straightforward during other recent crises, like the Asian one in the \u00d590s.\n\nIt\u00d5s entirely understandable, then, that the Obama administration, the Federal Reserve and Congress are looking for creative, legal ways to claw back some of the bonuses. That bonus money is really taxpayer money: absent a bailout, no A.I.G. would exist to pay bonuses.\n\nThe larger question is how to change the rules on corporate pay to reduce the odds of future crises. Throughout this crisis, policy makers, starting with President George Bush and Ben Bernanke and now including President Obama, have been a bit too deferential to Wall Street. That deference has fed populist anger, which threatens the political viability of the necessary continuing bailout of the credit markets.\n\nThe bonus scandal offers Mr. Obama and Mr. Bernanke a chance to get ahead of the curve \u00d1 so long as they come up with changes that extend well beyond A.I.G.\n\nThe starting point would be a rigorous analysis of whether the government can take specific steps to restrain pay. Some thoughtful management experts think any such efforts are doomed to fail. Others are more optimistic. \u00d2There are ways to do it,\u00d3 says Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard Law professor.\n\nAcross-the-board caps on pay don\u00d5t make sense. But perhaps the government can prevent companies from claiming a corporate tax deduction on any pay above a certain threshold. The current limit, which is $1 million, applies only to base salaries and thus has little meaning. Or perhaps companies can be penalized if they pay bonuses based on short-term profits, as A.I.G., Lehman Brothers and just about every other company recently has. The Fed made a suggestion along these lines recently, but it didn\u00d5t do anything more than ask nicely.\n\nIf no such ideas proved workable, there is still one more option. Today\u00d5s tax code makes no distinction between income above $373,000 and income above, say, $5 million. Both are taxed at 35 percent.\n\nThat is a legacy of the tax changes of the early 1990s, when far less of the nation\u00d5s income went to millionaires. Today, you can make a good argument for a new, higher tax bracket on the very largest incomes. In the past, the economist Thomas Piketty says, higher marginal tax rates tended to hold down salaries and bonuses, because executives had less incentive to angle for multimillion-dollar pay.\n\nDo these ideas stem in part from anger and bitterness? Of course they do. How can you not be a little angry and bitter about the role that huge, unjustified pay played in causing the worst recession in a generation?\n\nIn fact, that\u00d5s sort of the point. Given the damage that\u00d5s been caused by our decidedly unmeritocratic system of paying executives, the most irrational course of all would be the status quo."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " Consider the following health insurance plan.\n\nIn 2007, Senators Ron Wyden, above, and Robert F. Bennett introduced a bill that would have created an open marketplace for health care insurance. The effort was backed by only 13 other senators.\n\nIt refuses to pay for certain medical care and then doesn\u00d5t offer a clear explanation. It does pay for unhelpful care that ends up raising premiums. Its customer service can be hard to reach or unhelpful. And the people who are covered by this insurer have no choice but to remain with it \u00d1 or, at best, to choose from one or two other insurers that are about as bad.\n\nIn all likelihood, I have just described your insurance plan.\n\nHealth insurers often act like monopolies \u00d1 like a cable company or the Department of Motor Vehicles \u00d1 because they resemble monopolies. Consumers, instead of being able to choose freely among insurers, are restricted to the plans their employer offers. So insurers are spared the rigors of true competition, and they end up with high costs and spotty service.\n\nAmericans give lower marks to their health insurer than they do to their life insurer, their auto insurer or their bank, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Even the Postal Service gets better marks. (Cable companies, however, get worse ones.) No wonder President Obama\u00d5s favorite villain is health insurers.\n\nYou might think, then, that a central goal of health reform would be to offer people more choice. But it isn\u00d5t.\n\nReal choice is not part of the bills moving through the Democratic-led Congress; even if the much-debated government-run insurance plan was created, it would not be available to most people who already have coverage. Republicans, meanwhile, have shown no interest in making insurance choice part of a compromise they could accept. Both parties are protecting the insurers.\n\nThat\u00d5s a reflection of the thorny politics of health care. On one hand, big interest groups are lobbying hard to keep some form of the status quo. Insurers don\u00d5t want people to have more choice. Neither do employers and labor unions, which now control huge piles of money spent on health care. Nor do hospitals and drug makers, which benefit from all the waste now in the system.\n\nOn the other hand, the people who stand to benefit most from having more choice \u00d1 all of us \u00d1 are not agitating for change, because the costs of the system are hidden from us. A typical household spends $15,000 each year on health care. But most of it comes in the form of taxes or employer deductions from paychecks, which means insurance can seem practically free.\n\nAs a result, people may not like their insurer, but they don\u00d5t hate it, either. If anything, they are more anxious about losing their insurance than they are eager to be given more choice. And that anxiety has driven the White House\u00d5s decision to pursue a fairly conservative form of health reform.\n\nTo be clear, the versions of reform now floating around Congress would do a lot of good. They would make it far easier for people without an employer plan to get health insurance and would make some modest attempts to nudge the health system away from its perverse fee-for-service model.\n\nYet they would not improve most people\u00d5s health care anytime soon. Giving people more control over their own care would. White House advisers, however, decided against that option long ago. They worried that opening up the insurance market would destabilize employer-provided insurance and make Mr. Obama\u00d5s plan vulnerable to the same criticism that undid Bill Clinton\u00d5s: that it was too radical.\n\nThey may well have been right. Then again, given all the flak they have been taking anyway, they may have been wrong.\n\n\nThe best-known proposal for giving people more choice is the Wyden-Bennett bill, named for Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and Robert Bennett, a Utah Republican, who introduced it in the Senate in 2007. There are other broadly similar versions of the idea, too. One comes from Victor Fuchs, a Stanford professor sometimes called the dean of health economists, and Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and an Obama health-policy adviser.\n\nIn the simplest version, families would receive a voucher worth as much as their employer spends on their health insurance. They would then buy an insurance plan on an \u00d2exchange\u00d3 where insurers would compete for their business. The government would regulate this exchange. Insurers would be required to offer basic benefits, and insurers that attracted a sicker group of patients would be subsidized by those that attracted a healthier group.\n\nThe immediate advantage would be that people could choose a plan that fit their own preferences, rather than having to accept a plan chosen by human resources. You would be able to carry your plan from one job to the next \u00d1 or hold onto it if you found yourself unemployed. You would never have to switch doctors because your employer switched insurance plans.\n\nThe longer-term advantage would be that health insurance would become fully subject to the brutal and wonderful forces of the market. Insurers that offered better plans \u00d1 plans that drew on places like the Mayo Clinic to offer good, lower-cost care \u00d1 would win more customers.\n\n\u00d2That\u00d5s the way the rest of the economy works,\u00d3 says William Lewis, former director of the McKinsey Global Institute.\n\nPolitically, though, the full voucher plan is still too radical, which is why the Wyden-Bennett bill has attracted support from only 13 other senators \u00d1 four Republicans, eight Democrats and Joe Lieberman. So Mr. Wyden has come up with a narrower version.\n\nIt expands the exchange that Democratic leaders are already planning to create for the uninsured so that many more people would be allowed to use it. (If the exchange were limited to the uninsured, any government-run insurance plan, a crucial part of reform for many liberals, would not be available to most people.) But Mr. Wyden isn\u00d5t having much luck with this idea, either. The support for the employer-based system is simply too strong.\n\nAnd the defenders of the employer system have some legitimate arguments. An insurance exchange may end up having some of the same pitfalls as 401(k) plans, in which some workers make poor choices. Having employers navigate the complex landscape of insurance, the defenders say, may be better for employees.\n\nHere\u00d5s what I would ask those defenders, however: Given all the problems with health care \u00d1 the high costs and decidedly mixed results \u00d1 how comfortable are you defending the status quo? Why force people into a system you think is better for them?\n\nIf people were instead allowed to choose, all but a small percentage might indeed stick with their employer plan. In that case, a Wyden-like proposal wouldn\u00d5t amount to much. It certainly would not destabilize the employer-provided insurance system.\n\nThen again, if lots of families did switch to a plan on the exchange, the impact would be quite different. With fewer employees signing up for on-the-job insurance, companies might shrink their benefits departments. The number of companies offering insurance would keep dropping. The employer insurance system could begin to crumble.\n\nBut wouldn\u00d5t that be precisely the fate that the system deserved?"}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " The closest thing to a real estate crystal ball in the last few years has been the house auctions that are regularly held around the country.\n\nBefore the actual bidding began at a real estate auction in Washington, an auctioneer pretended to sell the Washington Monument as an example of how the process works.\n\nAt the real estate auction, a bidder assistant yells to signal to the auctioneer that an audience member decided, after a tense moment, to place a higher bid.\n\nIn 2006 and early 2007, the official housing statistics were still showing that house prices were holding up. But that was largely because so many sellers were refusing to sell. The auctions, made up mostly of foreclosed homes, showed the truth: house values were starting to plummet in many places.\n\nSo a few weeks ago, I decided to go to an auction at a hotel ballroom in Washington \u00d1 and to study the results of several others elsewhere \u00d1 with an eye to figuring out whether prices may now be close to bottoming out.\n\nThat\u00d5s clearly a huge economic question. Last week, JPMorgan\u00d5s chief financial officer told Eric Dash of The New York Times that JPMorgan, and presumably other banks, would be under pressure \u00d2until home prices stabilize and unemployment peaks.\u00d3 As long as home prices are falling, foreclosures are likely to keep rising and the toxic assets polluting bank balance sheets are likely to stay toxic.\n\nThere are reasons, though, to think that prices may be on the verge of stabilizing. Relative to fundamentals, like household incomes and rents, houses nationwide now appear to be overvalued by only about 5 percent. You can make an argument that the end of the housing crash is near.\n\nBut that\u00d5s not what I found at the auctions.\n\n\u00d2This is a perfect storm of opportunity,\u00d3 Bob Michaelis, goateed with a shaved head, told the 300 or so people who had come to downtown Washington for the auction.\n\nMr. Michaelis, the auction manager, spoke from a lectern on stage, and his goal seemed to be to persuade people that they might never see a buyers\u00d5 market as good as this one. Prices have plunged, and interest rates, he said, are at \u00d2generational lows.\u00d3 (The National Association of Realtors has been running a radio commercial this spring making a similar case.)\n\n\u00d2Look around to your left and your right, and you\u00d5ll see someone who sees an opportunity just like you do,\u00d3 Mr. Michaelis said. \u00d2We\u00d5re approaching the bottom of the market, I think. We\u00d5re approaching the bottom of the market, if we\u00d5re not there already.\u00d3\n\nHe then told the audience that, in the last 100 years, house prices have recovered from every downturn and gone on to reach record highs. Oh, and Wells Fargo and Countrywide were standing by, ready to offer financing to qualified auction buyers.\n\nIf nothing else, this sales pitch certainly had chutzpah. It combined the old bubble-era notion that house prices always rise over time (ignoring the fact that incomes, stock values and the price of bread do, too) with the new postcrash idea that houses must be a bargain because they\u00d5re a lot cheaper than they used to be. Even Countrywide, which was taken over by Bank of America after so many of its subprime mortgages went bad, is still part of the housing pitch.\n\nYet as soon as the auction began, it was clear that the pitch wasn\u00d5t working.\n\nThe winning bid on the first home auctioned off, a two-bedroom townhouse in Virginia Beach, was $115,000. Just last July, it sold for $182,000, according to property records. A four-bedroom brick house with a two-car garage in Upper Marlboro, Md., went for $375,000. Last year, it sold for $563,000.\n\nThroughout the evening, such low-ball prices continued to win the bidding. At one point, the auctioneer, Wayne Wheat, interrupted his sing-song auction call to cheerfully ask, \u00d2Where are my investors?\u00d3\n\nThe tables that had been set up around the edges of the ballroom, reserved for people planning to buy multiple houses, were mostly empty. Many audience members, like the man in a camouflage baseball cap just in front of me, were attending their first auction.\n\nOn Sunday, my colleague Carmen Gentile went to a larger auction, in Miami, to see if my experience had been unusual. It wasn\u00d5t. The homes there also sold for just a fraction of what they would have even a year ago. The rate of decline in Miami hasn\u00d5t even slowed noticeably in recent months, according to data kept by Real Estate Disposition Corporation, known as R.E.D.C., which runs the auctions.\n\nA recently transplanted New Yorker named Michael Houtkin won the bidding on a one-bedroom condominium on the outskirts of Boca Raton, a few blocks from three golf courses, for the incredible price of $30,000. \u00d2Things were almost being given away,\u00d3 he said later.\n\nAs is often the case at these auctions, the seller of the condo \u00d1 Fannie Mae \u00d1 retained the right to refuse the winning bid and keep the property. But Mr. Houtkin told me he was optimistic his bid would be accepted. An R.E.D.C. employee suggested to him that $30,000 wasn\u00d5t much below the minimum price that Fannie Mae had hoped to receive.\n\nHow could that be? Because Fannie Mae, like many banks, is inundated with foreclosed properties. In recent weeks, banks have begun accelerating foreclosures again, after having held off while waiting to find out which homeowners would be eligible for the Obama administration\u00d5s assistance program.\n\nThe glut of foreclosed homes creates a self-reinforcing cycle. Falling prices lead to more foreclosures. Foreclosures lead to an excess supply of homes for sale. The excess supply then leads to further price declines. Jan Hatzius, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs, says that the \u00d2massive amount of excess supply\u00d3 means that home prices nationwide will probably fall an additional 15 percent.\n\nThis estimate hides a lot of variation, too. In Miami, Goldman forecasts, prices could drop an additional 33 percent, which is pretty amazing since they\u00d5ve already fallen 50 percent from their 2006 peak.\n\nNor is excess supply the only reason prices still have a way to fall. Nationwide, homes may not be overvalued by much. But in some cities, including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago and Miami, they remain very expensive. So while Mr. Hatzius and his Goldman colleagues are somewhat more pessimistic than most forecasters, the difference isn\u00d5t enormous.\n\nI\u00d5ll confess that this bearish picture isn\u00d5t exactly what I had hoped to find. A year ago, as part of a move from New York to Washington, my wife and I bought our first house. We did so fully expecting prices to continue falling (though perhaps not as much as they ultimately will, given the severity of the financial crisis). But we decided they had fallen enough for us to take the plunge. We preferred buying before the bottom of the market instead of renting and having to move again in a year or two.\n\nStill, when I wrote about that decision last spring, I argued that anyone who didn\u00d5t have to move probably should not buy yet. Prices still had a way to fall.\n\nThey don\u00d5t have as far to fall today, but the great real estate crash is not over, either. So if you are part of the 30 percent of American households who rent and you\u00d5re trying to decide when to buy, relax.\n\nThe market is still coming your way."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " The long-awaited housing bailout will finally be announced on Wednesday.\n\nIn a speech in Phoenix, a signature real estate boomtown gone bust, President Obama will explain his plan to reduce foreclosures. And the key to understanding that plan will be remembering that there are two different groups of homeowners who are at risk of foreclosure.\n\nThe first group is made up of people who cannot afford their mortgages and have fallen behind on their monthly payments. Many took out loans they were never going to be able to afford, while others have since lost their jobs. About three million households \u00d1 and rising \u00d1 fall into this category. Without help, they will lose their homes.\n\nThe second group is far larger. It is made up of the more than 10 million households that can afford their monthly payments but whose houses are worth less than what is owed on their mortgages. In real estate parlance, they are underwater. If they want to stay in their homes, they will have no trouble doing so. But some may choose to walk away voluntarily, rather than continue to make payments on an investment that may never pay off.\n\nScratch beneath the details of any housing bailout proposal, and the fundamental issue is whether it tries to help the second group or just the first.\n\nMr. Obama has evidently decided to focus on the first group, based on the previews of his speech that aides have offered. In coming weeks, his administration will begin spending $50 billion to entice banks to reduce the monthly payments of people who otherwise couldn\u00d5t afford to stay in their houses. In effect, the government will split the losses on these mortgages with banks.\n\nThe $50 billion will come from the money Congress has already allocated for the bailout of the financial system. It is likely to be aimed at people who need a significant, but not an enormous, amount of help to meet their mortgage payments.\n\nThere are some big advantages to this approach. Bailing out all underwater homeowners would be tremendously expensive. All told, about $500 billion in mortgage debt is already underwater, and it\u00d5s impossible to know in advance who is likely to walk away. So the government would have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to help millions of people who don\u00d5t need help staying in their homes.\n\nBut the Obama approach also brings risks. The administration is betting that few of those 10 million underwater homeowners will walk away. (A year from now, the number will about 15 million, Moody\u00d5s Economy.com projects.) If they begin to abandon their homes in large numbers, however, they will aggravate the housing bust and the financial crisis \u00d1 and probably force the administration to come up with a new, much larger housing bailout down the road.\n\nIn that case, the speech that Mr. Obama is making in Phoenix could come to look like a rose-colored bit of incrementalism, which happens to be the very criticism that Obama advisers have leveled against the Bush administration\u00d5s response to the housing bust.\n\nUnderwater homeowners clearly face a difficult choice. By walking away from a house and then renting a similar one in the same town, many could save themselves a lot of money. And those who need to move \u00d1 to take a new job, for example, or to marry \u00d1 may have little choice but to default. They may not get enough from a sale to pay off the mortgage.\n\nOn the other hand, defaulting will wreck a homeowner\u00d5s credit rating. For families that don\u00d5t need to move, doing so will also bring other headaches and costs. They will be leaving behind their homes. Many other people may continue to make their payments simply because they think it\u00d5s the right thing to do.\n\nThe current housing bust doesn\u00d5t have a good recent historical analogy. It\u00d5s too big. But there have been some serious regional housing slumps that may offer a window into how underwater homeowners will behave this time.\n\nThree economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston recently did an analysis along these lines, looking at the Boston area in the early 1990s. From early 1989 until late 1991, prices in Boston fell 15 percent. They did not return to their 1989 peak until 1997.\n\nYet only 6.4 percent of homeowners who had been underwater at the end of 1991 were eventually foreclosed on. And the majority of these foreclosed homeowners weren\u00d5t merely underwater; they were also unable to make their monthly payments, because of the severe recession hitting New England at the time, as Chris Foote, an economist at the Boston Fed, told me. They are the kind of people the Obama plan is meant to help.\n\nIn all, maybe only 1 or 2 percent of underwater homeowners walked away even though they could make their payments. Mr. Foote and his colleagues predict that the nationwide foreclosure rate over the next few years will be higher than it was in Boston, but not radically so.\n\nFor most people, the Fed economists write, being underwater \u00d2is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for foreclosure.\u00d3 "}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": "How much of a difference will the stimulus make?\n\nTwo weeks ago, a Congressional committee posted a table of numbers on its Web site that gave an early answer. The numbers came from the Congressional Budget Office and seemed to show that only 38 percent of the money in the bill would be spent by September 2010. That didn\u00d5t sound very stimulating, and the numbers soon caused a minor media sensation.\n\nBut anyone who looked closely would have seen something strange about the table. It suggested that the bill would cost only $355 billion in all, rather than its actual cost of about $800 billion.\n\nWhy? It turns out that the table was analyzing only certain parts of the bill, like new spending on highways, education and energy. It ignored the tax cuts, jobless benefits and Medicaid payments \u00d1 the very money that will be spent the fastest.\n\nOn Monday evening, the Congressional Budget Office put out its analysis of the full bill, and it gave a very different picture. It estimated that about 64 percent of the money, or $526 billion, would be spent by next September.\n\nThat timetable may still be slower than ideal, and short of the 75 percent benchmark President Obama has promised, but it isn\u00d5t terrible. Spending hundreds of billions of dollars takes time. In fact, for all the criticism the stimulus package has been getting, it does pretty well by several important yardsticks.\n\nFirst of all, the package really is stimulus. It will quickly give money to the people who have been hardest hit by the recession and who, not coincidentally, will be most likely to spend that money soon. The spending also has a chance to do some long-term good, by paying for the computerization of medical records, the weatherization of homes and other such investments.\n\nBy my count, the current package has just one major flaw. It could do a lot more to change how the government spends its money. It doesn\u00d5t have nearly the amount of the fresh, reformist thinking as Mr. Obama\u00d5s campaign speeches and proposals did. Instead, the bill is mostly a stew of spending on existing programs, whatever their warts may be.\n\nI understand that this approach reflects the realities of political negotiations. It even has some economic merits: it may help speed the flow of money out the door. But it still is a missed opportunity in a few instances.\n\nThe biggest is infrastructure. Transportation experts had hoped the package would be the start of not only more spending on infrastructure but also smarter spending on highways, mass transit, sewer systems and other public works. So far, the experts are disappointed.\n\nIn the current system, the federal government sends money to states without any real effort to evaluate whether it will pay for worthy projects. States rarely do serious analyses of their own. They build new roads before fixing old ones. They don\u00d5t consider whether those new roads will lead to faster traffic or simply more traffic. They spend millions of dollars on legislators\u00d5 pet projects and hulking new sports stadiums. In the world of infrastructure, cost-benefit analysis is still a science of the future.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Ed Rendell, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, came to Washington to talk up infrastructure. He is a member of a tripartisan threesome \u00d1 along with Michael Bloomberg, New York\u00d5s independent mayor, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, California\u00d5s Republican governor \u00d1 trying to persuade the country to get serious about infrastructure.\n\nIn his talk, Mr. Rendell said he understood that the stimulus bill couldn\u00d5t come close to solving all these problems. But it could make some progress, and Mr. Obama\u00d5s sky-high approval ratings gave him a wonderful chance to do so. \u00d2This is the time to put down some markers \u00d1 this is the time,\u00d3 Mr. Rendell said.\n\nAnd the bill does include a couple of markers. It will list on the Web the projects that the federal government is financing \u00d1 an idea that, amazingly enough, is considered radical \u00d1 and will require that mayors and governors sign off on projects. That will make it harder for them to lobby for projects now and criticize those same projects later, as Gov. Sarah Palin did with the Bridge to Nowhere. At least one version of the bill also sets aside $5.5 billion to be awarded by the transportation secretary, supposedly on the merits of a project.\n\nBut it\u00d5s not clear how that will work, and there is so much more that could be done. The bill could create a small-scale version of an \u00d2infrastructure bank,\u00d3 a free-standing entity that could make more merit-based decisions than Congress does (an idea that Mr. Obama supports). The bill could also finance the creation of new state offices to conduct cost-benefit analyses. It could also help cover the budget shortfalls of public transit systems, instead of simply allocating another $30 billion for the construction of new highways.\n\nFifty-one transit systems have recently proposed service cuts or fare increases, including those in Atlanta, Denver, New York, Phoenix, St. Louis, San Diego and Washington. If these cuts go through, they will make it harder for people to get to work (or look for work), and they will undermine one of the long-term goals of the stimulus package: laying the groundwork for a greener economy.\n\nIt\u00d5s not just infrastructure, either. The bill includes big, admirable increases in college financial aid \u00d1 but appears likely to do little to use those increases to improve higher education. The package will also sprinkle millions of dollars on some debatable projects, like the renovation of the National Mall.\n\nThe standard that I\u00d5m setting here may seem a bit high. Even with its current flaws, the bill has much to recommend it. It will indeed try to encourage significant changes in health care and K-12 education, for example.\n\nThe bill is certainly superior to a huge package of tax cuts, which might be politically popular but end up in people\u00d5s bank accounts rather than stimulating the economy. By now, we should know that tax cuts are not a cure-all. The cuts of 2001 and 2003 couldn\u00d5t keep the recent expansion from being one of the weakest on record or the current recession from being so deep.\n\nThis bill should help the economy in both the near term and the long term. But the government doesn\u00d5t go out and spend about $800 billion every day. The details matter."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " The big influx of highly educated workers into finance in the last two decades has been the subject of some national hand-wringing lately. President Obama, college presidents and economists have all worried aloud that Wall Street has hoarded human resources that might otherwise have gone to science, education, medicine or other fields.\n\nClaudia Goldin studied Harvard College alumni, and the results were similar to those of the National Survey of College Graduates and a study of University of Chicago business graduates.\n\nNow, new research is suggesting that the shift also brought another cost \u00d1 a cost that fell mainly on the people, especially women, who took jobs in finance. Among elite white-collar fields, finance appears to be uniquely difficult for anyone trying to combine work and family.\n\nFinance, on this score, is worse than law and worse than academia. It is far worse than medicine, which emerges from the research as the highly paid profession with the most flexibility. Near finance at the bottom of the list is consulting, another field that became more popular in the last two decades.\n\nThe research, by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz of Harvard, answers a question that college students, for all their careful career planning, rarely consider: which jobs offer the best chance at balancing work and family life? A decade or two after college, however, that question often comes to dominate conversations among friends and between spouses.\n\nOn almost every aspect of work-life balance, finance and consulting look pretty bad. People who take time off in those fields suffer large penalties, both in terms of money and career opportunities, once they return to full-time work. And part-time jobs are hard to come by, which often forces people to make a choice between working a 70-hour week and leaving a job entirely.\n\nOne set of statistics neatly summarizes the findings. After surveying Harvard College alumni 15 years after graduation, Ms. Goldin and Mr. Katz estimated the average financial penalty for someone who had taken a year and a half off and then returned to work. In medicine, that person earned 16 percent less than a similar doctor who had not taken time off. Among people with no graduate degree, the gap was 25 percent. For both lawyers and Ph.D.\u00d5s, it was about 29 percent.\n\nFor M.B.A.\u00d5s, a group dominated by finance workers and consultants, it was 41 percent. Given how much money many make, they can probably do just fine even after such a pay cut. Yet the size of it suggests that time off puts them on a completely different career track.\n\n\u00d2The good news is that there are at least some professions where women have been able to carve out a set of policies that are compatible with family life,\u00d3 Jane Waldfogel, a Columbia professor who studies families, told me. \u00d2The challenge for the next generation \u00d1 and it isn\u00d5t just about women \u00d1 is to extend this to other occupations.\u00d3\n\nMs. Goldin and Mr. Katz, who are two of the country\u00d5s leading labor economists and have published the crux of these findings in the American Economic Review, studied Harvard graduates from the last 40 years. That allowed them to compare a fairly similar group of students over a long period, but had the disadvantage of creating a decidedly atypical survey group.\n\nSo the two economists compared their results to two other surveys \u00d1 the National Survey of College Graduates, run by the National Science Foundation, and a study of University of Chicago business school graduates \u00d1 and found broadly consistent patterns.\n\nAccording to the most recent National Survey, for instance, 21 percent of doctors in their late 30s and early 40s work less than 35 hours a week. The share was roughly 14 percent for M.B.A. graduates, as it was for lawyers and people with Ph.D.\u00d5s.\n\nThe idea that medicine offers more choices than other elite professions may come as a surprise, given that medical training requires notoriously long hours of study. But once doctors reach their 30s, many of them seem to be rewarded with a wider set of options than their counterparts in other fields.\n\nWhen I heard about the new findings, I immediately thought of two friends of mine, a pediatrician and ophthalmologist married to each other and living in Colorado. Their years of training were typically grueling. While they were in medical school and residency in Northern California in the 1990s, they were surrounded by people at dot-coms who were working shorter hours and making vastly more money.\n\nBut today, they have the best work-life balance of any parents I know. She works two and a half days a week and is on call eight weekends a year. He arrives at his office early every morning and takes short lunches so that he can work four days a week. He is also on call 10 weeks a year. They have jobs they love, and they spend a lot of time with each other and their children.\n\nAs Al Franken, the comedian turned politician, has observed, \u00d2Kids don\u00d5t want quality time. They want quantity time \u00d1 big, stinking, lazy, nonproductive quantity time.\u00d3 And research on emotional and intellectual development suggests that kids are right to want what they do."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " Timothy Geithner, Ben Bernanke and President Obama have been trying to persuade us that the latest financial rescue plan is meant to help us, not Wall Street. The goal, as Mr. Geithner said Monday, is to fix the markets for \u00d2small-business lending, large-business borrowing, consumer borrowing, auto finance, student loans, et cetera.\u00d3\n\nBut here\u00d5s a question: Do you know many people who want a loan and can\u00d5t get one?\n\nProbably not.\n\nAfter all, the number of homeowners refinancing their mortgages has tripled over the last few months. The salesmen at my local Toyota dealership tell me that getting a car loan is not a problem. No large company has failed to meet its weekly payroll, as Mr. Obama warned last year might happen. Indeed, if you try to come up with a single prominent victim of the credit squeeze on Main Street \u00d1 as opposed to victims of the recession \u00d1 you will have a hard time.\n\nThis creates a big political problem for the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve. Policy makers are deeply worried that public opinion will eventually cause Congress to abandon the rescue plan. That\u00d5s why they keep trying to connect the financial crisis to the day-to-day economy.\n\nBut their examples tend to be hypothetical \u00d1 hypothetical businesses that can\u00d5t expand or hypothetical families who can\u00d5t borrow. Meanwhile, Wall Street is benefiting from the bailout in concrete ways. A.I.G. traders receive bonuses. Money managers like BlackRock will receive subsidies in the latest bailout. As a banner on CNN put it on Monday afternoon, \u00d2Bankers Get Billions.\u00d3\n\nSo over the last few weeks, I\u00d5ve set out to figure out just how the financial crisis is \u00d1 and is not \u00d1 affecting Main Street. There is no doubt that the economy is in terrible shape. The overall volume of loans is, in fact, falling. But is that because banks won\u00d5t lend? Or because businesses and families don\u00d5t want to borrow?\n\n\u00d2You can bring the horse to water, but they may not drink,\u00d3 the bond investor Bill Gross recently told The Wall Street Journal, referring to the government\u00d5s efforts to increase lending.\n\nToday, I\u00d5m going to focus on one industry: the car rental business. It is a simple enough business, and it seems to be suffering from the credit squeeze. This month, Hertz, Enterprise and the Avis Budget Group successfully lobbied the Treasury Department to be eligible for loans from the bailout fund.\n\nYet the picture isn\u00d5t a simple one. The worst problem facing the car rental business, at least for now, is not a lack of credit.\n\nAnd you can say the same thing about the broader economy, which helps clarify the precise task that\u00d5s facing the White House and the Fed.\n\nThe car rental industry\u00d5s original sin isn\u00d5t so different from the economy\u00d5s. It took on too much debt.\n\nThe old Cendant Corporation loaded up Avis with debt before spinning it off as a separate company in 2005. Three private equity firms, including the Carlyle Group and a Merrill Lynch division, did something similar to Hertz the next year. The firms bought Hertz from the Ford Motor Company, piled on debt (largely to pay themselves $1 billion in deal fees \u00d1 lovely, eh?) and then took the company public.\n\nThese debts mean that the companies cannot take out the low-interest loans that a healthier company can. Instead, they must turn to the asset-backed securities market, where loans are split into little pieces and investors with an appetite for risk buy them. Avis and Hertz then get the money they need to buy cars for their fleets, in exchange for paying interest to the investors.\n\nThe mortgage market relied on the same trick, of course, and now that so many mortgage-backed securities have gone bust, the market for other asset-backed securities is moribund. Investors have lost their appetite for risk.\n\nLate last year, when Avis tried to renew a $1.35 billion credit line, it ran into trouble. It eventually managed to get the loan, but only at a steep interest rate. The interest on the full credit line will cost $40 million a year more than the interest on the old credit line. For comparison, Avis\u00d5s entire cash earnings last year were only $169 million.\n\nEven so, Ron Nelson, the company\u00d5s chief executive, recently said that the mere fact that it was able to renew the loan was \u00d2our most critical accomplishment\u00d3 in the fourth quarter. Without loans, the rental companies can\u00d5t buy cars, and without cars, they don\u00d5t have much of a business.\n\nBut here\u00d5s where the story gets complicated. Hertz has plenty of available cash, because none of its credit lines have come due recently. Enterprise, which is in better financial shape, hasn\u00d5t been squeezed either. Yet both companies are sharply cutting their vehicle purchases.\n\nOverall industry purchases are down 63 percent relative to early last year, and all three companies have also laid off workers.\n\nWhy? Because the economy is in terrible shape. Fewer people are traveling and renting cars. The companies already own too many cars, thanks to the sweetheart deals that Detroit offered in recent years to clear out its bloated inventory. \u00d2From our standpoint, there is no liquidity crisis,\u00d3 says Patrick Farrell, an Enterprise vice president. \u00d2We\u00d5re buying fewer cars because we need fewer cars.\u00d3\n\nAll this makes for a wonderful microcosm. The rental car business has been hurt by the credit squeeze. But it has bigger problems. And the company most affected by the squeeze, Avis, isn\u00d5t eager to talk in detail about it, presumably out of fear that more attention will further spook lenders.\n\nThe same dynamic is at work with small businesses. Many are struggling to get financing but are afraid to be identified publicly as a spurned borrower. Instead, they are quietly cobbling together loans any way they can and hoping the squeeze eases soon.\n\nIf it doesn\u00d5t, they \u00d1 and a whole lot of other businesses \u00d1 will be in trouble. Hertz has a credit line of about $2 billion coming due next year. Avis has more than $4 billion expiring over the next four years. At the current high interest rates, the costs would be crushing.\n\nSo it\u00d5s true that the credit crunch, for most households and businesses, isn\u00d5t yet a crisis. But that\u00d5s partly because of the steps the government has already taken, and without more progress, the crunch will become a crisis. The bailout, therefore, needs to continue.\n\nMr. Geithner\u00d5s new plan is meant to rid banks of those toxic securities and make bankers confident enough to lend more. Even if the plan works, the government may still need to take over the weakest banks. Mr. Geithner\u00d5s request on Tuesday for new powers seemed to be laying the groundwork for such takeovers.\n\nBut no bailout can fix the economy by itself.\n\nIn coming days, Congress will be debating the federal budget, and some members are threatening to reduce spending for next year in ways that would undercut the stimulus bill. At the G-20 summit meeting next week, meanwhile, European leaders have signaled that they will resist calls from the Americans and Chinese to get serious about their own stimulus programs.\n\nThe moral of the car rental story is that this isn\u00d5t the time for thrift. If people aren\u00d5t renting cars, Avis, Hertz and Enterprise won\u00d5t buy cars. And if the global economy doesn\u00d5t get some more help, the various bailouts won\u00d5t be able to end the recession on their own."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": "\u00d2The Wealth of Nations,\u00d3 1776\n\nThat quotation, from the great philosopher of capitalism, appeared at the start of an article that ran a few weeks ago in The New England Journal of Medicine. The article argued for taxing Coke, Pepsi, Gatorade, Red Bull and any other sugar-sweetened beverage, largely to combat obesity.\n\nThe authors were Kelly Brownell, a longtime obesity researcher at Yale, and Thomas Frieden, the New York City health commissioner. Since the article appeared, President Obama appointed Dr. Frieden to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSo one of the nation\u00d5s top public health officials is now a fierce proponent of a soda tax. Meanwhile, other Obama advisers and some Senate staff members have been talking about such a tax \u00d1 which wouldn\u00d5t apply to diet soda or real juice \u00d1 as a way to help pay for expanded health insurance. Among 15 options for paying for health care reform, a new Senate Finance Committee analysis lists a \u00d2sugar-sweetened beverage excise tax.\u00d3\n\nCoca-Cola and PepsiCo hate this idea, of course, and they\u00d5re fighting hard (if quietly) against it. Given the messy politics of tax increases, the industry seems likely to win this time. But the soda tax has already made the journey from unthinkable to plausible. It isn\u00d5t too hard to imagine that, some day soon, Congress or a state legislature will see the tax as the least bad way to raise desperately needed revenue.\n\nWhatever happens, the debate over soda tax is a useful one, because it does a nice job of capturing some of the most serious problems with our current tax system. Not only has the system been failing to collect enough revenue to cover government expenses, but it is also complex in all the wrong ways.\n\nThe tax code has layer upon layer of subsidies, deductions, exemptions and extra taxes that serve no good purpose. There is a huge exemption for employer-provided insurance, which has numbed us to the crushing cost of health care and is deeply unfair to people who must buy insurance on their own. There are hotel taxes, because it\u00d5s politically easy to tax out-of-towners. And there are taxes that seem to defy all reason, like New Jersey\u00d5s tax on health club memberships.\n\nOn the other hand, activities that really deserve to be taxed \u00d1 activities that place a cost on the rest of society \u00d1 often go untaxed or undertaxed. Economists refer to taxes on such activities as Pigovian taxes, after the 20th-century English economist Arthur Cecil Pigou who advocated them.\n\nPigovian taxes have the double advantage of discouraging costly activities and helping to cover the costs that remain. Tobacco taxes have become the shining example. Yet alcohol taxes have fallen 35 percent since the early 1990s, adjusted for inflation. We still don\u00d5t have a carbon tax or its cousin, a cap-and-trade system. Nor do we have a tax on excess calories.\n\nIn coldly economic terms, you can make a case that calories are the single best candidate for a Pigovian tax.\n\nMost public health scourges have a brutal way of holding down the associated medical cost: they kill people. That\u00d5s why preventive medicine doesn\u00d5t provide nearly the cost savings that some advocates claim. \u00d2One of the uncomfortable truths is that when you prevent an illness,\u00d3 says Dana Goldman, the head of the health economics program at the Rand Corporation, \u00d2you prolong a life and can increase costs.\u00d3\n\nObesity is different. It has only a modest effect on life span, but it causes costly chronic illnesses, like diabetes.\n\nFor some people, obesity is a matter of genetic predisposition, and it can\u00d5t be prevented. But most of today\u00d5s obesity problem is about behavior. The average 18-year-old is only a fraction of an inch taller than the average 18-year-old three decades ago, but 15 pounds heavier. Gene pools don\u00d5t change in three decades.\n\nSoda consumption has changed \u00d1 a lot. The typical person now consumes 190 calories a day from sugary drinks, up from 70 a day in the late 1970s. That 120-calorie increase represents about one-half of the total daily caloric increase during that span, C.D.C. data shows.\n\nOf all foods and beverages, says Mr. Brownell, the obesity researcher, \u00d2the science is most robust and most convincing on the link between soft drinks and negative health outcomes.\u00d3\n\nJust as important for the purposes of a soda tax, economic research has found that soda drinkers are price sensitive. In the past, when the price of soda has risen by 10 percent, consumption has dropped by an average of roughly 8 percent. This means a soda tax may not be quite as regressive as it sounds, because poor people would end up buying less soda than they now do.\n\nI found these arguments fairly compelling, and I wanted to hear how executives at Coke and Pepsi would respond. But they refused to talk.\n\nBryan Anderson, the head of Coke\u00d5s Washington office, and Dan Bryant, the head of Pepsi\u00d5s, didn\u00d5t return my calls. Spokesmen for the companies said the industry\u00d5s lobbying group, the American Beverage Association, was making all comments.\n\nAnd it definitely has been making some comments. The association has an unsigned blog that criticizes soda tax proponents as \u00d2well-paid professional food police\u00d3 at \u00d2East Coast universities.\u00d3 One recent entry was devoted to praising Bill Clinton \u00d1 whose foundation helps run a program that keeps some (but not all) sweetened drinks out of schools and has received money from the industry \u00d1 for coming out against a soda tax. \u00d2Mr. President,\u00d3 it concluded, \u00d2we thank you for being a stand-up guy.\u00d3\n\nWhen I got on the phone with Susan Neely, the association\u00d5s president, I tried to get beyond the name-calling and instead asked one question over and over: do you think the increase in sugary-drink consumption is an important reason obesity has increased?\n\nMs. Neely, in a pleasant tone, wouldn\u00d5t answer. She kept answering different questions, like whether soda was the only reason we have gained so much weight.\n\n\u00d2I think that we are consuming too many calories from a variety of sources and not getting enough exercise,\u00d3 she finally said.\n\nIt\u00d5s certainly true that a soda tax, by itself, won\u00d5t solve the multibillion-dollar obesity problem. A true Pigovian approach would be much broader. It would get rid of the current government subsidies for corn syrup \u00d1 and that New Jersey gym tax. It would use taxes and subsidies to reverse the long-term decline in the price of junk food and the long-term rise in the price of fruits and vegetables. Some economists say health insurance premiums should be lower for people who keep fit.\n\nAs Ms. Neely says, \u00d2It\u00d5s a simple equation \u00d1 calories in, calories out.\u00d3\n\nIndeed it is. We just shouldn\u00d5t lose sight of how many of those \u00d2calories in\u00d3 come from Coke, Pepsi and the like. If we could cut back on our soda drinking, we would be both thinner and richer."}

The cause of death was ovarian cancer, her sister, Cathy Stickelmaier, said.\n\nThanks in large part to Tanta\u00d5s contributions, Calculated Risk became a crucial source of prescient analysis as the housing market at first faltered, then collapsed and finally spawned a full-blown credit crisis.\n\nTanta used her extensive knowledge of the loan industry to comment, castigate and above all instruct. Her fans ranged from the Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times who cited her in his blog, to analysts at the Federal Reserve, who cited her in a paper on \u00d2Understanding the Securitization of Subprime Mortgage Credit.\u00d3\n\nShe wrote under a pseudonym because she hoped some day to go back to work in the mortgage industry, and the increasing renown of Tanta in that world might have precluded that. Tanta was Ms. Dungey\u00d5s longtime family nickname, Ms. Stickelmaier said.\n\nCalculated Risk, which gets about 75,000 visitors a day, was started in early 2005 by a retired technology executive named Bill McBride. The housing market was soaring, but Mr. McBride sensed that the industry was about to peak, and he posted articles and data that made his case.\n\nThe blog quickly drew a lively and informed group of commentators, few livelier and none more informed than someone who called herself Tanta. She began by correcting some of Mr. McBride\u00d5s posts. \u00d2She would tell me either I was wrong or the article I was quoting was wrong,\u00d3 he said Sunday. \u00d2It was clear she really knew her stuff. And she was funny about it.\u00d3\n\nTanta soon graduated from merely commenting to being a full-scale partner. Her first post, in December 2006, took issue with an optimistic Citigroup report that maintained that the mortgage industry would \u00d2rationalize\u00d3 in 2007, to the benefit of larger players like, well, Citigroup.\n\n\u00d2Bear with me while I ask some stupid questions,\u00d3 Tanta wrote, and proceeded to assert that the industry was less likely to \u00d2rationalize\u00d3 than fall apart, which it did. Citigroup was bailed out by the government last month.\n\nShe loved the intricacies of mortgage financing and would joke about being not just a nerd on the subject but a nerd\u00d5s nerd. She eventually wrote, for the Calculated Risk site, \u00d2The Compleat \u0086berNerd,\u00d3 13 lengthy articles on mortgage origination channels, mortgage-backed securities and foreclosures that constituted a definitive word on the subject.\n\nThe rest of the time, Tanta liked to chew on the follies of regulators, the idiocies of lenders and \u00d1 a particular favorite \u00d1 clueless reporters, which according to her was just about all of them.

{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "After a worrisome start to the growing season that fanned fears of food shortages and huge economic losses, the nation\u00d5s most important crop is now on track for a bountiful harvest, the government said Tuesday.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture is forecasting the second-highest corn yield on record with production of 12.3 billion bushels, about 600 million bushels more than it had expected earlier in the summer.\n\n\u00d2We dodged a bullet,\u00d3 said Bill Nelson, a Wachovia grains analyst.\n\nAs cool weather in April and downpours in May gave way to widespread flooding in June, prospects seemed miserable for corn. That crop has long been the most important feed used in meat production, and in recent years it has increased in importance as ethanol made from corn has become a government-mandated gasoline additive.\n\nMany farmers had to replant their washed-out fields; some ran out of time to do so. Food industry groups went to battle with ethanol interests, saying there was not enough corn for both food and fuel. Corn futures prices soared to an unheard-of $8 a bushel, triple the price of a few years ago.\n\nSome analysts worried that $9 or even $10 a bushel was possible. That price would probably have been ruinous to livestock producers and ethanol plants alike, although corn farmers would have been in clover.\n\nBut after the floodwaters receded, nature turned benign. In the Midwest this summer, the weather has been exactly what the tender young corn stalks needed to thrive. \u00d2Not too hot, not too cold, not too wet, not too dry,\u00d3 Mr. Nelson said.\n\nCorn prices, which have been falling for weeks, settled Tuesday at $5.28 a bushel, up 11 cents.\n\nThe highest corn yield on record was 160.4 bushels an acre in 2004. The new 2008 estimate of 155 bushels is up 3.9 bushels from last year\u00d5s harvest. Total production will be lower than last year\u00d5s bumper crop, because farmers planted fewer acres of corn.\n\nThe soybean crop is slightly more of a question mark, since it was planted even later than corn. The government is forecasting a harvest of 2.97 billion bushels, down about 30 million bushels from its earlier forecasts. But that is much better than many had expected in June.\n\nPalle Pedersen, an agronomist at Iowa State University in Ames, said it was too early to tell how the soybean crop would turn out in the state, which was hit hardest in the flooding. \u00d2I think the government yield estimates are too high,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2A lot of disease is coming in, killing the fields.\u00d3\n\nSoybean futures have also fallen back, although not as much as corn. At the beginning of July, they exceeded $16 a bushel. On Tuesday, they settled at $12.14.\n\nThe jump in commodity prices this year became a major burden on livestock producers and other food industry groups, which began campaigning for relief. But their cause has had two major setbacks in the last month.\n\nThe Agriculture Department decided not to let farmers take land out of conservation programs without penalty, a measure that would have increased production in 2009. Then the Environmental Protection Agency denied a request by the governor of Texas to reduce for one year the mandate on ethanol production.\n\nDespite the much-improved prospects for the crops, and thus lower prices for feed, the livestock producers\u00d5 enthusiasm was muted Tuesday.\n\n\u00d2The crop report is certainly a good thing,\u00d3 a National Chicken Council spokesman, Richard Lobb, said. \u00d2But we\u00d5re still basically just squeaking through. The federal government seems to be relying on a policy of hoping for good weather, not just this year but in the coming years.\u00d3\n\nFarmers, who are inherently cautious, are not banking on any good news until after the harvest is safely in the silos. The government corn yield estimate of 155 bushels an acre is a dream to some of them.\n\nDan Meinhart, a farmer in Effingham, Ill., said the conditions in his area did not reflect the government\u00d5s optimism. Mr. Meinhart had to replant nearly all his corn and beans after the rains washed them away. He is expecting a corn yield of 130 bushels. The beans do not look great either.\n\n\u00d2Spanish needles are blooming already, and the old-timers say that means it will frost in six weeks,\u00d3 Mr. Meinhart said. \u00d2We need at least eight to 10 weeks to get the crop in.\u00d3\n\nIn its report, the government said that corn yields would be higher than last year in the northern and eastern corn belt, but lower in the southern half of the Great Plains because of drought. Soybean yields are projected to be lower in the Midwest, a consequence of the troubles this spring, but higher in most other places.\n\nThe report is based primarily on phone interviews with 29,500 producers. Agriculture Department personnel went back to 8,910 tracts in the Midwest after the floods and did special interviews with farmers about their planted acreage and harvest intentions."}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "Just in time for a recession, the debt collection industry in the United States is working to shed its reputation for remorselessly hounding their targets.\n\nThe collectors still want the money. But now they would like to be seen as helpful and sympathetic, even a force for good.\n\nThey have started calling the indebted \"our customers.\" They are pushing consumer tips on the ideal way to respond when a collector comes calling (basically: pay up). They note that debt collecting is an old American tradition. (Some histories and biographies say that Abraham Lincoln, among many other things, was a debt collector.) They point out how, in a time of rising unemployment, they are hiring.\n\n\"Collectors actually care about consumers,\" said Rozanne Andersen, general counsel of ACA International, the main industry trade group. \"They want to teach consumers how to get out of debt. They're trying to put themselves out of business.\"\n\nIf so, they are doing a poor job. So many people are in so much debt that the government says bill collecting is one of the fastest-growing U.S. businesses. By 2016, employment in it is projected to exceed half a million workers, up 23 percent in a decade.\n\nWhen that projection was made in 2006, the times seemed comparatively good. Many Americans were paying their bills by refinancing their homes. That era is rapidly receding as home equity shrinks, foreclosures spiral upward and credit card defaults increase.\n\nThe data are scant on the number of debtors or how much they owe, but it is clear that even mild downturns can push millions toward insolvency. The number of borrowers who were at least four months behind on a credit card, auto, house or installment loan doubled after the 2001 recession, to nearly seven million, according to credit bureau data analyzed by a Federal Reserve economist.\n\nWhen a bill goes unpaid, the credit card company, hospital, store or other creditor usually makes efforts to collect. If that fails, the debt is assigned for collection or sold outright to third-party agencies. In 2005, 150,000 such debt collectors took in $51.4 billion, a PricewaterhouseCoopers study indicated.\n\nA weak economy yields more work for third-party collectors but not necessarily higher revenue because unemployed debtors as a rule cannot pay. The industry thinking is that if collections can be made less adversarial, the success rate may go up.\n\n\"Most of our customers want to pay,\" said Gary Wood, president of DBA International, a group of debt buyers and collectors. \"We want a relationship that will enable the customer to satisfy their need to pay what they owe and at the same time enable us to feed our families.\"\n\nACA International, through its foundation, is developing a personal financial management course, which it plans to post on its Web site next month and promote in national newspaper advertisements.\n\nA draft version offers a view from the collector's perspective: It recommends that consumers who are victims of identify theft contact the Federal Trade Commission, but does not say that they can do the same if they have complaints about collectors. (They can.)\n\n\"You attract more flies with honey than with vinegar,\" the ACA foundation's chairman, William Wilcox, said. \"This is just a start.\"\n\nThere is another reason for the collection industry's public relations push: tough economic times could bring more scrutiny of collectors by legislators and regulators.\n\n\"Collectors are in a jam,\" said Robert Hunt, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, who follows the industry. \"The business is so big and the anecdotes so nasty, they can't hide.\"\n\nMuch better, Hunt said, to take the initiative.\n\nEven in the relatively good times in the middle of this decade, complaints about the industry consistently rose. In 2006, the most recent figures available, the Federal Trade Commission received 69,204 complaints against third-party collectors, more than quadruple the number in 2001.\n\nMany people said the collectors misrepresented the character, amount or legal status of a debt. Others said the collector harassed them by calling repeatedly or continually, used obscene language or threatened dire consequences if no payment was forthcoming.\n\nCollectors say the complaints are a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions of communications a year they have with debtors, and should not be used as a lever to tighten regulation.\n\nTo protect its interests, ACA International, formerly the American Collectors Association, opened a full-time Washington lobbying office this month."}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "Newly empowered by the Supreme Court, the attorneys general of several states hit hard by the housing collapse are exploring consumer fraud suits against major mortgage lenders.\n\n\nA foreclosed home in Miami Gardens, Fla. Attorneys general around the country may decide to sue banks over lending practices that have resulted in a wave of foreclosures.\n\nLisa Madigan is the attorney general of Illinois.\n\nFrustrated by the banks\u00d5 inability or unwillingness to stop an avalanche of foreclosures, the states are considering lawsuits over the creation and marketing of millions of bad loans as well as the dismal pace of mortgage modifications.\n\nSuch cases would have been impossible until recently, because federal regulators had exclusive oversight of national banks. But a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision in June allowed the states to exercise their own supervision, giving them significant leverage.\n\n\u00d2We tried to use the tool to be persuasive with the banks,\u00d3 Arizona\u00d5s attorney general, Terry Goddard, said in an interview. \u00d2But their waterfall of excuses, the abysmal numbers of modifications, tells us persuasion is not working.\u00d3\n\nAs a result, he said, \u00d2we\u00d5re moving much closer to litigation.\u00d3\n\nWhile statutes vary, those of every state prohibit fraud in consumer lending. The attorneys general are considering the theory that the banks essentially perpetrated a vast fraud on consumers by marketing exotic loans that would prove impossible to pay back.\n\nDuring the boom, the banks earned short-term fee income from generating the loans, then quickly resold most of them to investors or to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored housing agencies that eventually required costly taxpayer bailouts.\n\nThe Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group, declined to comment on the possibility of state fraud lawsuits. A spokesman, John Mechem, warned that consumers would end up paying for any campaign of stepped-up legal activity.\n\n\u00d2Lawsuits add to the patchwork of regulations that increases compliance costs for lenders, which in turn increases the cost of credit for borrowers,\u00d3 Mr. Mechem said.\n\nThe states\u00d5 new power to sue banks arose from an effort in 2005 by Eliot Spitzer, then the New York attorney general, to discover whether several banks had violated the state\u00d5s fair-lending laws.\n\nThe banks balked at surrendering any information. The Clearing House Association, a consortium of national banks, and the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency filed suit, asserting the states had no authority over national lenders.\n\nMr. Spitzer\u00d5s successor, Andrew M. Cuomo, took up the battle. Lower courts agreed with the banks, but the Supreme Court, narrowly, did not.\n\nAlready, the states\u00d5 victory in Cuomo v. Clearing House is beginning to affect the legal landscape. \u00d2The handcuffs are off,\u00d3 said Ann Graham, a professor of banking law at Texas Tech University. \u00d2The states can pursue justice now.\u00d3\n\nIn July, the Illinois attorney general, Lisa Madigan, filed a civil rights case accusing Wells Fargo of predatory lending. While the case was in the works for 18 months, Ms. Madigan said \u00d2it would have been much more difficult to bring\u00d3 without the favorable Clearing House ruling.\n\nThe impact goes beyond housing issues. In West Virginia, a case brought by the state against Capital One, charging deceptive marketing of credit cards, was blocked by a judge in June 2008. The judge said the state did not have authority to pursue the case. After the Clearing House decision, West Virginia filed a request to reinstate the case.\n\nOther states say they are just beginning to explore their new powers.\n\n\u00d2We\u00d5re back on the field,\u00d3 said Iowa\u00d5s attorney general, Tom Miller. \u00d2That\u00d5s really important. Certainly there will be some litigation.\u00d3\n\nIn Arizona, the number of state lawyers working on mortgage issues went from one to eight after Clearing House. \u00d2Before the court\u00d5s decision, we wouldn\u00d5t waste our time looking at national banks,\u00d3 said Robert Zumoff, senior litigation counsel for Mr. Goddard.\n\nThe Clearing House ruling rolled back an expansion of federal authority that began more than five years ago. In January 2004, the Comptroller of the Currency, the agency responsible for regulating national banks, issued two rule changes that had a far-reaching effect on the ability of state banking regulators and law enforcement to pursue violations of state law by large banks and their subsidiaries.\n\nThe rule changes broadened the protections afforded to national banks against prosecution for violations of state civil rights and predatory lending laws and other banking statutes. In a statement announcing the regulations, then-comptroller John D. Hawke Jr. said that his agency would take the lead on preventing lending abuses by the banks.\n\n\u00d2Predatory lending is a very significant problem in many American communities, but there is scant evidence that regulated banks are engaged in abusive or predatory practices,\u00d3 Mr. Hawke said then. \u00d2Our regulation will ensure that predatory lending does not gain a foothold in the national banking system.\u00d3 "}

They are heading toward a winter wheat pasture.\n\nWhen the price of wheat, corn, soybeans and just about every other food grown in the ground began leaping skyward two years ago, farmers were pleased, of course. But generally they refused to believe that the good times would be permanent. They had seen too many booms that were inevitably followed by busts.\n\nNow, with the suddenness of a hailstorm flattening a field, hard times are back on the American farmstead. The price paid for crops is dropping much faster than the cost of growing them.\n\nThe government reported this week that the cost of goods and services nationwide fell by a record amount in October as frantic businesses tried to lure customers. While lower prices are good for consumers in the short run, a prolonged stretch of deflation would wreak havoc as companies struggled to stay afloat.\n\nIn this lonesome stretch near the Texas border, farmers are getting an early taste of a deflationary world. They have finished planting next year\u00d5s winter wheat, turning the fields a brilliant emerald green. But it cost about $6 a bushel in fuel, seed and fertilizer to put the crop in. That is $1 more than they could sell it for today, and never mind other expenses like renting land.\n\nThis looming loss sharpens their regret that they did not unload more of this year\u00d5s crop back when they harvested it in May. They knew the boom would end, but not so soon.\n\n\u00d2I waited all my life for wheat to go from $4 to $5,\u00d3 said Jimmy Wayne Kinder, a fourth-generation farmer. \u00d2Then it hit $10, and we were all asking, \u00d4What are we going to do?\u00d5 \u00d3\n\nMr. Kinder, who farms about 5,000 acres with his father, James Kinder Jr., and his brother, Kevin, held onto much of his wheat, hoping that prices would go still higher. Instead, they plunged. \u00d2I lay in bed at night kicking myself,\u00d3 Mr. Kinder said.\n\nThe farmers in Walters still have to worry about drought and floods and grain bugs and army worms, as they have for decades, but they have new anxieties beyond their control: Manic commodity markets. A rising dollar that makes their crops more expensive overseas. And \u00d1 an urgent new concern this fall \u00d1 the solvency of their banks.\n\nIn September, when banks began failing at the height of the credit crisis, Mr. Kinder called Mickey Harris, his banker at the First State Bank of Temple. \u00d2Are we going to be O.K.?\u00d3 he asked.\n\nMr. Harris offered reassurances that the privately owned, one-location bank was fine, but he feels the fate of farmers, until recently one of the strongest sectors in a slumping economy, is less certain.\n\nUnless wheat stages an unexpected recovery, Mr. Harris said, \u00d2a year from now these farmers\u00d5 net worth will surely be less.\u00d3\n\nOklahoma exports two-thirds of its wheat, more than the country as a whole. That worked to the state\u00d5s advantage in 2007 and the first half of 2008, as a combination of bad harvests in Australia, the cheap dollar and rising Asian consumption created intense international demand.\n\nThe state\u00d5s farmers responded, naturally enough, by ramping up production. Because of better weather and therefore a better yield, 166.5 million bushels of wheat were harvested in Oklahoma this spring, a 10-year high. And because of the high prices, the crop was valued for the first time at more than $1 billion, nearly twice as much as 2007 and nearly three times as much as 2006.\n\n\u00d2They made a killing,\u00d3 said Kim Anderson, a grain economist at Oklahoma State University.\n\nAssuming, that is, they sold. The farmers who cashed in at the right moment are acquiring legendary status. \u00d2I know a fellow that sold some wheat for $12 a bushel. That was almost beyond belief,\u00d3 said James Kinder, 74.\n\nBut his son suspects that most were like the Kinder family: they either did not sell or did not sell enough.\n\nThe Kinders still have about 40 percent of their wheat, stored on the farm and in commercial grain facilities. \u00d2Farmers are terrible marketers,\u00d3 said Jimmy Wayne Kinder, 50. \u00d2We fall in love with our crop.\u00d3\n\nIt was the same misguided optimism that caused homeowners to think their houses would always keep increasing at a 20 percent annual clip. Farmers across the country fell prey to it.\n\nDavid Kanable at the Oregon Farm Center, a mill near Madison, Wis., was paying $7.25 a bushel for corn in June. \u00d2We never had a farmer lock in at that price. They wanted $8,\u00d3 Mr. Kanable said. On Thursday, the mill was paying $3.17 a bushel."}

Expenses for the diesel fuel used to run tractors and combines and for the fertilizer essential to modern agriculture have soared. Mr. Miller does not just want high prices; he needs them to pay his bills.\n\nUntil recently, he could expect around $3 a bushel for his wheat \u00d1 far less than his parents and grandparents received, when inflation is taken into account. Consumption in the United States was dropping as Americans shunned carbohydrates. The export market, while healthy, faced competition.\n\nNow prices have more than tripled, partly because of a drought in Australia and bad harvests elsewhere and also because of unslaked global demand for crackers, bread and noodles. In seven of the last eight years, world wheat consumption has outpaced production. Stockpiles are at their lowest point in decades.\n\nAround the world, wheat is becoming a precious commodity. In Pakistan, thousands of paramilitary troops have been deployed since January to guard trucks carrying wheat and flour. Malaysia, trying to keep its commodities at home, has made it a crime to export flour and other products without a license. Consumer groups in Italy staged a widely publicized (if also widely disregarded) one-day pasta strike last fall.\n\nIn the United States, the price of dry pasta has risen 20 percent since October, according to government data. Flour is up 19 percent since last summer. Over all, food and beverage prices are rising 4 percent a year, the fastest pace in nearly two decades.\n\nThe American Bakers Association last month took the radical step of suggesting that American exports be curtailed to keep wheat at home, though the group later backed off.\n\nIf all this suggests a golden age for American growers, it could well be brief, said Bruce Babcock, an economist at Iowa State University. He predicted that farmers would do their best to ramp up production, possibly to the point of pulling land out of conservation programs so they could plant more. \u00d2Give farmers a price incentive, and they\u00d5ll produce,\u00d3 he said.\n\nThe Agriculture Department forecasts that world wheat production will increase 8 percent this year. In the United States, spring and durum wheat plantings are expected to rise by two million acres, helping to drive prices down to $7 a bushel, the government said.\n\nYet the competition among crops for acreage has become so intense that some farmers think the government and analysts like Mr. Babcock are being overly optimistic.\n\nRead Smith, a farmer in St. John, Wash., thinks a new era is at hand for all sorts of crops. \u00d2Price spikes have usually been short-lived,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2I think this one is different.\u00d3\n\nHis example is plain old mustard. Two years ago, Mr. Smith would have been paid less than 15 cents a pound for mustard seeds. As more lucrative crops began supplanting mustard, dealers raised their offering price to 20 cents, then 30 cents, then 48 cents early this year. Mr. Smith gave in, agreeing to convert up to 100 acres of wheat fields to mustard.\n\nMr. Smith said it was inevitable that supermarket mustard, just like flour, bread and pasta, would become more expensive.\n\n\u00d2We\u00d5ve lulled the public with cheap food,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2It\u00d5s not going to be a steal anymore.\u00d3\n\nBread to Be Had, for a Price\n\nAs the newly urbanized and newly affluent seek more protein and more calories, a phenomenon called \u00d2diet globalization\u00d3 is playing out around the world. Demand is growing for pork in Russia, beef in Indonesia and dairy products in Mexico. Rice is giving way to noodles, home-cooked food to fast food.\n\nThough wracked with upheaval for years and with many millions still rooted in poverty, Nigeria has a growing middle class. Median income per person doubled in the first half of this decade, to $560 in 2005. Much of this increase is being spent on food.\n\nNigeria grows little wheat, but its people have developed a taste for bread, in part because of marketing by American exporters. Between 1995 and 2005, per capita wheat consumption in Nigeria more than tripled, to 44 pounds a year. Bread has been displacing traditional foods like eba, dumplings made from cassava root.\n\nNigeria\u00d5s wheat imports in 2007 were forecast to rise 10 percent more. But demand was also rising in many other places, from Tunisia to Venezuela to India. At the same time, drought and competition from other crops limited supply.\n\nSo wheat prices soared, and over the last year, bread prices in Nigeria have jumped about 50 percent.\n\nAmid a public outcry, bakers started making smaller loaves, hoping customers who could not afford to pay more would pay about the same to eat less. Sales have dropped for street hawkers selling loaves. With imports shrinking, mills are running at half capacity.\n\nAt Honeywell Flour Mills, one of the largest in Nigeria, executives were glued one recent day to commodity screens. The price of wheat ticked ever upward. \u00d2Even when you see a little downturn, you wait for some few hours or a day, and before you know it, it\u00d5s gone way up again,\u00d3 said the production director, Nino Albert Ozara.\n\nDespite the crisis, there is little sense of a permanent retreat from wheat in Nigeria. The mills are increasing their capacity, hoping for a day when supply is sufficient to stabilize prices. \u00d2The moment you develop a taste, you are hooked,\u00d3 said a confident Muyiwa Talabi, director of an American wheat-marketing office in Lagos.\n\nMr. Ojuku, the man who buys fewer loaves, and one of his fellow tailors in Lagos, Mukala Sule, 39, are trying to adjust to the new era.\n\n\u00d2I must eat bread and tea in the morning. Otherwise, I can\u00d5t be happy,\u00d3 Mr. Sule said as he sat on a bench at a roadside cafe a few weeks ago. For a breakfast that includes a small loaf, he pays about $1 a day, twice what the traditional eba would have cost him.\n\nTo save a few pennies, he decided to skip butter. The bread was the important thing.\n\n\u00d2Even if the price goes up,\u00d3 Mr. Sule said, \u00d2if I have the money, I\u00d5ll still buy it.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": " Catfish farmers across the South, unable to cope with the soaring cost of corn and soybean feed, are draining their ponds.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s a dead business,\u00d3 said John Dillard, who pioneered the commercial farming of catfish in the late 1960s. Last year Dillard & Company raised 11 million fish. Next year it will raise none. People can eat imported fish, Mr. Dillard said, just as they use imported oil.\n\nAs for his 55 employees? \u00d2Those jobs are gone.\u00d3\n\nCorn and soybeans have nearly tripled in price in the last two years, for many reasons: harvest shortfalls, increasing demand by the Asian middle class, government mandates for corn to produce ethanol and, most recently, the flooding in the Midwest.\n\nThis is creating a bonanza for corn and soybean farmers but is wreaking havoc on consumers, who are seeing price spikes in the grocery store and in restaurants. Hog and chicken producers as well as cattle ranchers, all of whom depend on grain for feed, are being severely squeezed.\n\nPerhaps nowhere has the rise in crop prices caused more convulsions than in the Mississippi Delta, the hub of the nation\u00d5s catfish industry. This is a hard-luck, poverty-plagued region, and raising catfish in artificial ponds was one of the few mainstays.\n\nThen the economics went awry. Feed is now more than half the total cost of raising catfish, compared with a third of the cost of beef and pork production, according to a Mississippi State analysis. That makes catfish more vulnerable. But if the commodities continue to rocket up \u00d1 and some analysts believe they will \u00d1 other industries will fall victim as well.\n\nKeith King, the president of Dillard & Company, calculates that for every dollar the company spends raising its fish, it gets back only 75 cents when they go to market.\n\n\u00d2What\u00d5s happening to this industry is sad, but being sentimental won\u00d5t pay the light bill,\u00d3 Mr. King said.\n\nDillard and other growers take their fish, still squirming, to Consolidated Catfish Producers in the hamlet of Isola, where workers run the machinery that slices them into filets. With fewer fish coming in, Consolidated Catfish is resorting to layoffs.\n\nOne hundred employees were let go in the last month, and an additional 200 will be cut soon. President Dick Stevens predicts that by the end of the year the company will have jobs for only 450, about half the number at its peak. That might not be enough to keep the plant open.\n\n\u00d2The industry is going to implode,\u00d3 Mr. Stevens said. He blamed the government\u00d5s ethanol mandates for making fuel compete with food for the harvest of the nation\u00d5s farmland. \u00d2Politicians were in a rush to do something, and it became a terrible snowball.\u00d3\n\nAcross the highway, one of the local feed mills, Producers Feed Company, has already shut down. The ripple effects have begun: between the grain mill and the fish plant was Peter Bo\u00d5s Restaurant, locally celebrated for, naturally, its catfish. Hanging on the door is a \u00d2for rent\u00d3 sign.\n\nSome catfish producers recently switched to a feed based on gluten, a cheaper derivative of corn, to reduce their costs. But corn gluten transportation and prices were particularly hard hit by the Midwest floods.\n\n\u00d2As sick as we were over what happened to the Iowa farmers, we were also sick over what was going to happen to us,\u00d3 Mr. Stevens said.\n\nIt is a feeling echoed by others who depend on corn and soybeans.\n\nIn the spring, hog farmers thought they were past the worst. Export sales to China were strong. Corn appeared to level off. Some farmers sought an edge by reformulating pigs\u00d5 diets and reducing the weight at which they sent the animals to the packer.\n\n\u00d2And then corn goes up another buck, and you\u00d5re back where you were,\u00d3 said Dave Uttecht, a producer in Alpena, S.D., who raises 70,000 pigs a year.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5m a farmer.

Her mortgage broker told her she ran afoul of new rules requiring two years of sufficient tax returns from some home buyers, instead of only one.\n\n\u00d2Everyone says this is a buyer\u00d5s market, but they wouldn\u00d5t let me buy,\u00d3 said Dr. Komarovskaya, 30. \u00d2It\u00d5s not fair.\u00d3\n\nNot fair, perhaps, but far from unique, brokers and agents say. The readiness of banks to sell foreclosed properties has led to rising home sales in some areas. But the traditional housing market, the one that involves willing buyers and sellers, is still dead, with transactions lower than they have been for decades.\n\nThe recession is the major reason sales are dragging, of course, but it is not the only one. As Dr. Komarovskaya found, buyers once viewed as perfectly qualified are being denied mortgages.\n\nBrokers and bankers say that in past decades, the credit markets would almost certainly have accommodated many of these people.\n\n\u00d2The credit pendulum is stuck at \u00d4stupid,\u00d5\u00d3 said Lou S. Barnes, an owner of Boulder West Financial Services, a Colorado mortgage bank. \u00d2I am turning down loans every day that my grandfather in his Ponca City, Okla., savings and loan in 1935 would have been happy to make. And he was tough.\u00d3\n\nThe denials are occurring for a wide array of reasons: the buyers\u00d5 incomes are adequate but irregular; they are self-employed and take many deductions, reducing the taxable income on which lenders focus; their credit scores are below the cut-off point, which has been raised drastically; their down payments are less than 20 percent.\n\nHousing usually leads the country into a recession, which certainly happened this time, and also leads it out \u00d1 which will not happen in 2010, the real estate industry contends, without stronger efforts to thaw the market.\n\nNo one is advocating a return to the lax lending standards of 2006, when buyers with no income or documentation could get loans. But many people say they believe lenders and the government, in correcting the excesses of that era, have gone too far in the other direction.\n\nFannie Mae, the government-controlled company that buys mortgages, is so dominant in the lending market that its rules set the standard. It recently toughened its policies, saying it would count only 70 percent of the value of stocks and mutual funds when calculating a buyer\u00d5s assets. Previously, that figure was 100 percent.\n\nA Fannie spokesman, Brian Faith, said tighter regulations screened out those unprepared to be owners.\n\n\u00d2One of the important lessons learned in the past few years is that it is not enough to help a borrower own a home,\u00d3 Mr. Faith said. \u00d2We must also help ensure that they will be able to stay in the home over the long term.\u00d3\n\nMortgage brokers say those who are being rejected for loans are often entrepreneurs who are used to taking risks. \u00d2They are chomping at the bit to get into this market, but are forced to the sidelines,\u00d3 said Stuart Fraass of Guaranteed Rate Inc. \u00d2If you\u00d5re self-employed, you have virtually no chance of getting a mortgage now.\u00d3\n\nMr. Fraass was unable to help Raghbir Singh, a real estate investor who owns a gas station in Dover, N.H. Mr. Singh tried to buy a $301,000 house for himself and his family with 10 percent down and excellent credit, but was rejected. \u00d2It was unfair,\u00d3 Mr. Singh said. \u00d2I\u00d5m a good risk, but I\u00d5m forced to rent.\u00d3\n\nLately, the continued deep-freeze in the traditional market has to some extent been veiled by the brisk sale of foreclosed houses. In April, distressed transactions made up nearly half of all existing house and condo sales, the National Association of Realtors said. In May, they were a third.\n\nThat means traditional or so-called move-up sales, where the parties at both ends of the transaction are individuals instead of banks, are limping along at an annual rate of about three million, the lowest figure in a quarter-century.\n\n\u00d2Without further action, we\u00d5re not going to stabilize,\u00d3 said Steve Murray of Real Trends, a Denver research group. \u00d2The real estate recovery will take 10 or 12 years.\u00d3\n\nThere are plenty of plans to unlock the market.\n\nMembers of Congress are proposing to extend and enlarge an $8,000 credit for first-time buyers, which is due to expire in December. One bill would extend the credit to all buyers through next June. Another would extend it to all buyers through 2010. A third bill would expand it to $15,000 for all buyers.\n\nSome economists, noting that tax incentives helped stoke the boom, say these proposals should be shunned. \u00d2When do you decide enough is enough?\u00d3 said the housing consultant Ivy Zelman. \u00d2I don\u00d5t want to feed the drug addict with more drugs.\u00d3\n\nThe continuing deterioration in traditional real estate can be seen in the market in Massachusetts, where the economy, as measured by the unemployment rate, is better than in the nation as a whole.\n\nYet sales of single-family homes in Massachusetts in May were tied for the lowest level for the month in the 22 years since reliable statistics were first assembled, according to Timothy M. Warren Jr. of the Warren Group, which collects real estate data. Condo sales were only marginally better.\n\nAs bleak as those numbers may be, they do not fully convey the troubles here in the upper half of the market. In towns where the median home price is above $500,000, sales during the first five months of the year were 21 percent below the level of 1990, when the state\u00d5s population was smaller and the local economy equally in crisis.\n\nReal estate agents, always optimistic, had looked for some recovery this spring, the strongest season in the Northeast. Mr. Warren said he was more pessimistic, but was disappointed anyway. \u00d2There\u00d5s a lot of pent-up demand, but it takes nerves of steel to buy,\u00d3 he said.\n\nDr. Komarovskaya, the rejected dentist, tries to be philosophical about missing out on that two-bedroom condo she wanted in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. She understands that after years of mortgage abuse and fraud, the rules had to be tightened.\n\nBut what might be an inevitable process in the larger economy is a burden on her personal finances. \u00d2Renting is a waste of money,\u00d3 she said. Having no choice, she has dropped plans to buy and signed a new apartment lease."}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "Not long ago, the sheriff of Wayne County in Michigan warned that the wave of foreclosures sweeping across Detroit and the rest of his territory was a threat to law-abiding citizens.\n\n\u00d2Public safety is imperiled,\u00d3 Sheriff Warren C. Evans wrote to the governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, \u00d2by the number of foreclosed citizens living on the street or committing crimes with the actual intent of being jailed.\u00d3\n\nStripped of their own house, the foreclosed were choosing the Big House.\n\nThis is the sort of misfortune that happens when times are bleak and so many are pushed to the brink. Crime and violence of all sorts ramp up. People burn their cars for the insurance money. They rob. They steal. They kill themselves.\n\nOr so we assume. But if bad times have a special mythology, the reality is more elusive. In this extreme recession, reports of such incidents are easy to find \u00d1 despite the fact that actual statistical increases in such behavior are often inconclusive if not downright illusory. The American Association of Suicidology, for instance, felt compelled to issue a statement in January saying that historically there is no clear association between periods of economic distress and suicide. Maybe this recession will be different, but that will not be clear until all the numbers have been collected a few years from now.\n\nThe voluntary prisoner in search of \u00d2three hots and a cot\u00d3 is a persistent figure in American popular culture. He turns up in the folklore of the Depression and reappears in Bill Sands\u00d5s \u00d2My Shadow Ran Fast,\u00d3 a bestseller in the 1960s that humanized life behind bars. And of course there was Otis Campbell, the town drunk on \u00d2The Andy Griffith Show\u00d3 who let himself in and out of his cell at whim.\n\nA spokesman for Sheriff Evans, who was pursuing an ill-fated bid to become mayor of Detroit, referred me to Jeriel Heard, Wayne County\u00d5s chief of jails and courts. \u00d2Before, we would get a dozen voluntary incarcerations a year,\u00d3 Chief Heard said. \u00d2Now we\u00d5re looking at four or five a week.\u00d3\n\nThe crimes committed were mostly of the public-disorder variety, he said, purposely done in front of the police to attract their attention: throwing an empty wine bottle or urinating in public, perhaps breaking into a foreclosed house. The offenders were seeking not only food and shelter but medical care. They had no previous criminal history. \u00d2The criminal justice system,\u00d3 Chief Heard said, \u00d2is becoming the safety net of last resort.\u00d3\n\nChad Audi, the president of Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, a program that operates a shelter and works with former prisoners, also said he was seeing a troubling increase in intentional commitments, although in his experience the people involved often had done time before.\n\n\u00d2They love to go to jail, because this is their comfort zone,\u00d3 Dr. Audi said. \u00d2One man told us he went and stole a bag of chips from a gas station just so he could go to jail and get help for his teeth. That is how petty this is.\u00d3\n\nWith the jails filling up, Dr. Audi said he worried that the lawbreaking would not remain petty much longer. \u00d2People will be forced to commit a violent crime to get into the system,\u00d3 he said.\n\nAs if in confirmation, a man named James A. Roberts in February robbed a bank in Lincoln, Neb., of $3,000, and then waited outside until the police came. Mr. Roberts, 52, told the police that he had been laid off and could not find a place to live. In his mug shot, he looked pleased.\n\nExamples in Detroit, however, have been harder to come by. Chief Heard agreed to set up an interview with a prisoner driven to crime by the recession the next time one arrived. But no one did. Social service workers were generally dismissive of the idea. In the shelters, the homeless said they had heard stories of people intentionally getting themselves locked up but that was long ago.\n\nOne of them, Kevin Allen, 54, said he couldn\u00d5t imagine trying to put himself in jail. \"I did six months when I was 18, and that was enough for me,\" Mr. Allen said.\n\nThe mythology of bad times also calls for a rise in insurance scams. Accounts of car torchings are indeed plentiful. A Tucson man who owed much more on his 2006 Dodge Charger than it was worth is accused of persuading his daughter\u00d5s boyfriend to set it on fire. In exchange, the man agreed to let the boyfriend marry the girl. Both are now facing charges. There have been dozens of other stories only slightly less bizarre.\n\nYet research by John R. Hall Jr. of the National Fire Protection Association has shown that intentional fires of all sorts have been declining since 1980, and that there were no notable spikes in recession years. One reason: Revenge or spite was a more common motive in arson than profit.\n\nIf any crime were boosted by economic downturns, it would likely be burglary and other forms of theft. But in Los Angeles, where unemployment and foreclosures are rampant, crimes of all types are falling. Property crimes, for instance, are down 7 percent this year compared with 2008, the Los Angeles Police Department said last week.\n\nAs for Detroit\u00d5s voluntary incarcerations, the chief of jails now says the people doing this are so unbalanced they literally might not know what they are doing.\n\nBrian Moore, a 49-year-old homeless Detroit man, says he thinks that is about the only way it could be happening.\n\nSome time ago, in the middle of a miserable winter, Mr. Moore was so empty of luck that he decided he had no choice but to go back to jail. He had only a single dollar left, he recalled, and it was ripped in half. So he decided to go to a neighborhood restaurant, where he would stuff himself and then reveal he had no money. The police would handle the rest.\n\nAt the restaurant, Mr. Moore feasted on meatloaf and mashed potatoes and fried chicken while drinking three cups of coffee and a bottle of soda. The waitress was already eyeing him suspiciously. All he had to do was confess. But with his stomach full and his body warm, freedom regained its allure, he said. Mr. Moore waited until the waitress was distracted and then ran out the door."}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "So many people have so many things they can no longer afford. This is an excellent time to be a repo man.\n\nJeff Henderson, president of Harrison Marine (left), and his assistant, Larry McClelland, try out master keys on a boat being repossessed. \n\nWhen a boat owner defaults on his loan, the bank hires Jeff Henderson to seize its property. The former Army detective tracks the boat down in a backyard or a marina or a garage and hauls it to his storage area and later auctions it off. After nearly 20 years in the repossession business, Mr. Henderson has never been busier.\n\n\u00d2I used to take the weak ones,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2Now I\u00d5m taking the whole herd.\u00d3\n\nBoating was traditionally the pastime of the well-off, but the long housing boom and its gusher of easy credit changed that. People refinanced their homes and used the cash for down payments on a cruiser, miniyacht or sailboat. From 2000 to 2006, retail sales for the recreational boating industry rose by more than 40 percent, to $39.5 billion, while the average loan amount more than tripled to $141,000.\n\nLast year, as real estate faltered, the gears went into reverse. The number of boats sold fell 8 percent. Many boats are fuel hogs, and rising gasoline and diesel prices meant a weekend jaunt could cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Owners found they could not sell a boat for what they owed and could not refinance either.\n\nThe solution for some is simply to stop paying on Jersey Dreamin\u00d5 or Just Do It or Bally Hoo. Then one day they come home and it is gone.\n\nMr. Henderson\u00d5s company, Harrison Marine, has seven employees as well as half a dozen part-timers, making it one of the largest boat repo operations in the country. The business usually slacks off in the spring as the boating season begins and delinquent owners try to fend off the bank long enough to have some fun.\n\nNot this year. Mr. Henderson, 48, is repossessing nearly a boat a day, most from the Great Lakes area but a few farther afield. He is looking for a man from the Bronx named Rocko, who told the bank his 34-foot cruiser was at a marina that does not exist. He is trying to get a Michigan woman to tell him where to find her husband\u00d5s pontoon boat.\n\nThe bigger the boat, the harder to hide. A few miles from Mr. Henderson\u00d5s office is a house that, even in depressed Michigan, would sell for a million dollars. Tied up on the canal in back, just visible from the street, is a 40-foot Silverton yacht. As Mr. Henderson surveyed the area the other day, something nagged at his memory.\n\nFinally he remembered: \u00d2I\u00d5ve taken this boat before.\u00d3 Owners of repossessed boats have a few weeks to redeem them, and this fellow had availed himself of the opportunity. Now, a few years later, he was in trouble again. Mr. Henderson shrugged. \u00d2I took it before, I\u00d5ll take it again. After I take it a few more times, he\u00d5ll be eligible for a Christmas card. One guy, I took his boat four times.\u00d3\n\nBoat loans, like car loans, give the bank permission to recover its collateral in the case of default, which explains why a repo man can go into a yard without technically trespassing. Nevertheless, the custom is to get in and get out before the owners, neighbors or authorities notice anything amiss.\n\nIf the boat is in a marina, the pace is somewhat more leisurely. People delinquent on their boat loans also tend to be behind with their dock payments; since Mr. Henderson pays any overdue charges, most marinas are delighted to help him.\n\nIn search of Toy Box, a 34-foot Donzi Express with green stripes, he called about two dozen marinas, finally finding it on the Detroit River. On a recent afternoon, he had it pulled out of winter storage.\n\nAs soon as it was in the water, Mr. Henderson and his assistant, Larry McClelland, went through their set of master boat keys until one fit. Mr. McClelland fiddled with the engines, which were not in great repair. Tune-ups are another expense that the delinquent tend to avoid.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes, Toy Box seemed seaworthy enough to start the 90-minute trip back to Harrison Marine. It was a nice day, but Mr. Henderson was not particularly enjoying himself. He is the sort of man who likes to travel under sail, not by motor.\n\n\u00d2Sailing is a pure sport,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2It\u00d5s you against the water, you against the wind. It\u00d5s more pleasurable than sitting here bouncing down the lake.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "A \u00d2residential unit\u00d3 is one where the renter tries to illegally live in the unit. \u00d2We used to see one or two residential units a month,\u00d3 Mr. Reger said. \u00d2Now I\u00d5m seeing 6 or 8 or 10. At one facility in D.C. the other day, we had three residentials.\u00d3\n\nNot every area is seeing an increase in auctions. Neal Grossman, who runs auctions at storage facilities in Ohio, said a higher percentage of storage customers are rescuing their possessions at the last minute.\n\nWhen renters default on their monthly payments, facilities replace the lock with one of their own. That way, the renter cannot come around at the last minute and empty out his unit.\n\nMr. Grossman cut locks on 87 units in March but, as many people paid at the last minute, ended up auctioning only 21 of them in April. Both numbers were down from a year ago, he said, suggesting \u00d2the worst is behind us.\u00d3\n\nIn Chicago, on the other hand, the ranks of the dispossessed seem to be swelling. Storage facilities in Illinois that intend to auction off units in default must publish a legal notice alerting the owners. The suburban Daily Herald ran notices for 62 auctions in the Chicago metro area on a recent Monday, some of them involving more than 10 units.\n\nBrook Snyder runs the Chicago operation for Blair Auction. A good-humored 34-year-old with a penchant for bright shirts and three-day stubble, Mr. Snyder has made a career of delivering bad news: He has been an assistant to court officers doing evictions as well as a process server delivering legal papers to people being sued.\n\n\u00d2I try to treat everyone with respect,\u00d3 Mr. Snyder said. \u00d2Anyone can have hard times.\u00d3\n\nOn auction days he drives from site to site, trailing a caravan of hopeful bidders. When everyone is assembled in front of a defaulted unit, he takes off the lock. Forbidden to enter or touch, bidders make offers based on a glimpse and well-honed instinct. The entire process is over in a moment.\n\nIn three brisk days, Mr. Snyder held auctions at 23 U-Store-It facilities. At the first site, in Gurnee north of the city, he raised the door on an indoor unit, revealing what was essentially a one-room apartment: bed raised high, recumbent bicycle in the corner, file cabinet, vacuum cleaner and, for power, many extension cords. The contents sold for $675.\n\nThe next warehouse, in Waukegan, brought a unit full of \u00d1 depending on how you look at it \u00d1 cherished household possessions or somebody\u00d5s trash. Most of the bidders took the latter view, disdaining an offer. Tonya Boyd bought the bulging plastic bags for all of $6. \u00d2It looks like someone had some troubles,\u00d3 said Ms. Boyd, an employment specialist. There were piles of clothes, brand-new women\u00d5s shoes, old chairs, a dirty fan, kitchenware.\n\nFor some units, $6 is too much. \u00d2A dollar bill, first dollar bill takes it,\u00d3 Mr. Snyder implored in front of one unit. \u00d2Come on, this is everything they own!\u00d3 To no avail.\n\nThis is the eternal mystery of self-storage. If the material was worth money, it was foolish to let it go to default. If it was not worth much, why spend at least $50 a month to store it?\n\nMr. Jernigan, the U-Store-It executive, says budgets are stretched tight. \u00d2People pay their cellphone, rent, credit card before they get down to their storage unit,\u00d3 he said.\n\nSelf-storage site managers describe an irrational tendency in some clients. One said she had seen customers who lost their possessions at auction come back and rent another unit. Mr. Snyder said he had removed a lock from the same delinquent unit six times in one year. Five times the renter had paid up at the last minute; the sixth time, a few weeks ago, it was auctioned.\n\n\u00d2His luck ran out,\u00d3 Mr. Snyder said."}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "U.S. book publishers and booksellers are full of foreboding - even more than usual for an industry that has been anticipating its demise since the advent of television. The holiday season that just ended is likely to have been one of the worst in decades. Publishers have been cutting back and laying off. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that it would not acquire any new manuscripts, a move akin to a butcher shop proclaiming it had stopped ordering fresh meat.\n\nAmerican bookstores, both new and secondhand, are faltering as well.\n\nOlsson's, the leading independent chain in Washington, went bankrupt and shut down in September. Robin's, which says it is the oldest bookstore in Philadelphia, will close next month. The once-mighty Borders chain is on the rocks. Powell's, the huge store in Portland, Oregon, said sales were so weak that it was encouraging its staff to take unpaid sabbaticals.\n\nDo not blame this carnage on the recession or any of the usual suspects, including increased competition for the reader's time or diminished attention spans. What is undermining the book industry is not the absence of casual readers but the changing habits of devoted readers.\n\nIn other words, it is all the fault of people like myself, who increasingly use the Internet both to buy books and later, after their value to us is gone, to sell them. This is not about Amazon peddling new books at discounted prices, which has been a factor in the book business for a decade, but about the rise of a worldwide network of amateurs who sell books from their homes or, if they are lazy like me, in partnership with an Internet dealer who does all the work for a chunk of the proceeds.\n\nThey get their books from friends, yard sales, recycling centers, their own shelves, castoffs. Some list them for as little as a penny, although most aim for at least a dollar. This growing market is achieving an aggregate mass that is starting to prove problematic for publishers, new bookstores and secondhand bookstores.\n\nFor readers and collectors, these resellers, as they are called, offer a great service. Lost in the hand-wringing over the state of the book industry is the fact that this is a golden age for those in love with old-fashioned printed volumes: More books are available for less effort and less money than ever before. A book search engine like ViaLibri.net can knit together 20,000 booksellers around the world offering tens of millions of nearly new, used or rare books.\n\nOne consequence has been to change the calculations traditionally involved in buying a book: Given the price, do I really want to read this? Now it has become an economic and a moral issue. How much do I want to pay, and where do I want that money to go? To my community via a bookstore? To the publisher? To the author?\n\nIn theory, I want to support all of these fine folks. In practice, I decide to save a buck.\n\nHere is one example of how I casually wreak destruction. I was reading \"Sylvia,\" an account by the late short-story master Leonard Michaels of his unstable first wife. Looking for material about Michaels, I saw his friend Wendy Lesser had written a long essay about him in a book published last year by Pantheon. I could buy a new paperback edition of that book, \"Room for Doubt,\" for $13.95 plus tax in a bookstore. But there were dozens of copies available online from resellers for as little as one cent, plus shipping.\n\nA penny felt a little chintzy, even for me, so I bought a hardcover copy for 25 cents from someone who called herself Heather Blue, plus a few bucks for shipping. Neither my local bookstore nor Pantheon - whose parent, Random House, announced this month it would cut costs by reducing five divisions to three - nor the author got a share. The book looked good as new.\n\nLesser is the publisher of The Threepenny Review, a literary journal. She lives in Berkeley, California, where, as it happens, there is no longer a large, general-interest bookstore. Cody's, which was once one of the country's great stores, closed its last outlet in June. The Barnes & Noble store there also recently closed.\n\nAndy Ross, the former owner of Cody's, told me that buying books online \"was not morally dubious, but it is tragic. It has a lot of unintended consequences for communities.\""}

The tax base is gone. So are most of the residents. The population, about 18,000 after World War II, has declined to less than 3,000. Many of those who remain are unemployed. Real estate prices fell 50 percent in the last year.\n\n\u00d2Everyone in the country is asking, \u00d4Where\u00d5s the bottom?\u00d5 \u00d3 said the mayor, John Fetterman. \u00d2I think we\u00d5ve found it.\u00d3\n\nMr. Fetterman is trying to make an asset out of his town\u00d5s lack of assets, calling it \u00d2a laboratory for solutions to all these maladies starting to knock on the door of every community.\u00d3 One of his first acts after being elected mayor in 2005 was to set up, at his own expense, a Web site to publicize Braddock \u00d1 if you can call pictures of buildings destroyed by neglect and vandals a form of promotion.\n\nHe has encouraged the development of urban farms on empty lots, which employ area youths and feed the community. He started a nonprofit organization to save a handful of properties.\n\nIn an earlier era, Braddock was a famed wellspring of industrial might. The steel baron Andrew Carnegie put his first mill in the town, the foundation of an empire that helped build modern America. With the loot and guilt Mr. Carnegie piled up, he also built a library here, the first of more than 1,500 Carnegie libraries in the United States.\n\nImmigrants came to work in the mill, and through ceaseless agitation won union representation that enabled their children \u00d1 helped by the library on the hill \u00d1 to achieve a better life.\n\nA local boy, Thomas Bell, celebrated this hard-won success in his autobiographical 1941 novel \u00d2Out of This Furnace.\u00d3 The story recounts the strivings of three generations in Braddock\u00d5s mill and their transformation from exploited and maligned \u00d2Hunkies\u00d3 from Eastern Europe into full-fledged Americans.\n\nThis year, the town will be featured in the film version of another work of art, Cormac McCarthy\u00d5s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \u00d2The Road.\u00d3 Set in a post-Armageddon America where food is so scarce that many survivors turned to cannibalism, \u00d2The Road\u00d3 was shot partially in Braddock.\n\nA town whose story has evolved from building America to making Americans to eating Americans for dinner might seem a hard sell. So Mr. Fetterman, who is paid $150 a month, also promotes Braddock as a place to buy extremely cheap real estate.\n\nErik and Shannon Gustafson heeded that call. The couple were living in Chicago, where Mr. Gustafson was a part-time commodities trader, when they heard about Braddock last winter. They settled on a two-bedroom house whose owner warned them that it had black mold and was probably a tear-down. Her price: $4,750.\n\nThe Gustafsons paid the money and discovered that the mold problem was overstated. \u00d2Space is cheap here,\u00d3 said Mr. Gustafson, 30. \u00d2We can afford to focus on our hobbies.\u00d3 He is a graphic designer; she is a photographer.\n\nJoel Rice, a furniture maker, bought a 15,000-square-foot former car dealership that he is converting to a showroom, workshop and home, with a greenhouse on the roof. The building cost $70,000, perhaps a tenth of what he would have had to pay for a tiny shop in Oregon, where he was living.\n\nIt will take at least two more years to clear the debris and put in new wiring, plumbing and fixtures. But Mr. Rice, 38, is undaunted. \u00d2If all our effort here crashes and burns,\u00d3 he said, \u00d2it won\u00d5t be because we held anything back.\u00d3\n\nUnlike many stricken steel towns, Braddock never lost its mill. Part of the U.S. Steel system, it still employs nearly a thousand workers. But they no longer live in town, and the stores followed them to the suburbs. Eventually, only the stubborn and those without resources remained.\n\n\u00d2Even the bars and liquor stores closed,\u00d3 said Ron Kutnansky, who was born in Braddock in 1953 and lived there and in North Braddock for decades.

{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": " The catfish industry is in free fall, unable to cope with the soaring cost of corn and soybean feed. Producers across the South are draining their ponds and wondering what comes next.\n\n\"It's a dead business,\" said John Dillard, who pioneered the commercial farming of catfish in the late 1960s. Last year Dillard & Company raised 11 million fish. Next year it will raise none. People can eat imported fish, Dillard said, just as they use imported oil.\n\nAs for his 55 employees? \"Those jobs are gone.\"\n\nCorn and soybeans have nearly tripled in price in the last two years, for many reasons: harvest shortfalls, increasing demand by the Asian middle class, government mandates for corn to produce ethanol and, most recently, the flooding in the Midwest.\n\nThis is creating a bonanza for corn and soybean farmers but is wreaking havoc on consumers, who are seeing price spikes in the grocery store and in restaurants. Hog and chicken producers as well as cattle ranchers, all of whom depend on grain for feed, are being severely squeezed.\n\nPerhaps nowhere has the rise in crop prices caused more convulsions than in the Mississippi Delta, the hub of the nation's catfish industry. This is a hard-luck, poverty-plagued region, and raising catfish in artificial ponds was one of the few mainstays.\n\nThen the economics went awry. Feed is now more than half the total cost of raising catfish, compared with a third of the cost of beef and pork production, according to a Mississippi State analysis. That makes catfish more vulnerable. But if the commodities continue to rocket up \u00d1 and some analysts believe they will \u00d1 other industries will fall victim as well.\n\nKeith King, the president of Dillard & Company, calculates that for every dollar the company spends raising its fish, it gets back only 75 cents when they go to market.\n\n\"What's happening to this industry is sad, but being sentimental won't pay the light bill,\" King said.\n\nDillard and other growers take their fish, still squirming, to Consolidated Catfish Producers in the hamlet of Isola, where workers run the machinery that slices them into filets. With fewer fish coming in, Consolidated Catfish is resorting to layoffs.\n\nOne hundred employees were let go in the last month, and an additional 200 will be cut soon. President Dick Stevens predicts that by the end of the year the company will have jobs for only 450, about half the number at its peak. That might not be enough to keep the plant open.\n\n\"The industry is going to implode,\" Stevens said. He blamed the government's ethanol mandates for making fuel compete with food for the harvest of the nation's farmland. \"Politicians were in a rush to do something, and it became a terrible snowball.\"\n\nAcross the highway, one of the local feed mills, Producers Feed Company, has already shut down. The ripple effects have begun: between the grain mill and the fish plant was Peter Bo's Restaurant, locally celebrated for, naturally, its catfish. Hanging on the door is a \"for rent\" sign.\n\nSome catfish producers recently switched to a feed based on gluten, a cheaper derivative of corn, to reduce their costs. But gluten transportation and prices were particularly hard hit by the Midwest floods.\n\n\"As sick as we were over what happened to the Iowa farmers, we were also sick over what was going to happen to us,\" Stevens said.\n\nIt is a feeling echoed by others who depend on corn and soybeans.\n\nIn the spring, hog farmers thought they were past the worst. Export sales to China were strong. Corn appeared to level off. Some farmers sought an edge by reformulating pigs' diets and reducing the weight at which they sent the animals to the packer.\n\n\"And then corn goes up another buck, and you're back where you were,\" said Dave Uttecht, a producer in Alpena, South Dakota, who raises 70,000 pigs a year.\n\n\"I'm a farmer. I'm used to peaks and valleys.\" Uttecht said. \"But this is like falling into the Grand Canyon.\"\n\nSmaller herds will eventually put a floor under hog prices, and there is already some liquidation going on. But in the short term, sending more hogs to market will increase the supply of pork and push prices down further.

The great steel mills of Pennsylvania and the Midwest had literally built this country, but the twin burdens of competition and self-inflicted wounds had brought them to the edge of extinction.\n\nTHE GOOD OLD DAYS A worker pours molten steel at a Texas plant in 1967 when the industry was still robust.\n\nIf they were allowed to go under, their partisans warned, the consequences would ripple through the economy at a cost too high to bear. The old saying, \u00d2As steel goes, so goes the nation,\u00d3 was as much a threat as a boast.\n\nThe Detroit automakers are using the same argument as they seek a $25 billion bailout from Congress. \u00d2What happens in the automotive industry affects each and every one of us,\u00d3 a General Motors Web site declares, warning that the consequences of a shutdown would be \u00d2devastating.\u00d3\n\nYet steel\u00d5s savior was not the government bailouts it ardently sought but exactly what it so long tried to avoid: bankruptcy. Only when the companies failed were they successfully slimmed down and retooled into smaller but profitable ventures. As debate continues over what, if anything, should be done for G.M., Ford and Chrysler, the steel industry may offer a model.\n\nThe steel and auto industries are both capital-intensive enterprises that peaked a half-century ago and have been intermittently embattled ever since. Both secured peace with their unions by vastly expanding benefits, a bargain that eventually hobbled them. Both had entrenched layers of management that believed \u00d1 despite all evidence \u00d1 they could wish away change.\n\nThere are also key differences. Steel is essentially a straightforward commodity industry: the companies compete on price. Auto sales are often ruled by consumer perceptions. This has been a problem for Detroit. Many of its customers long ago fled for Toyota and Honda and a bankruptcy would scare away many more.\n\nThe steel industry was beginning its long stumble when it turned to Washington for help in the late 1970s. The Carter administration responded by committing $300 million in loan guarantees to five struggling companies. Nearly a third of the funds went to help Wisconsin Steel, a Chicago outfit that had been around since the previous century.\n\nThanks to a strike at a key customer, Wisconsin Steel promptly went under. The company locked its gates one winter day without even bothering to notify its 3,000 employees that their wages were history. So was most of the government\u00d5s money.\n\nDespite this fiasco, Jimmy Carter\u00d5s successors tried to deliver on demands for relief. In 1984, Ronald Reagan imposed import quotas to stem the tide of cheap foreign steel. In 1999, Bill Clinton guaranteed $1 billion in loans to beleaguered producers, and the following year imposed punitive tariffs on some imports.\n\nIt was never enough, particularly after the rise of low-cost minimills. By late 2001, their industry reeling, the steel makers wanted more from Washington: further protection from imports; pressure on other countries to reduce their steel-making capacity; and billions of taxpayer dollars to relieve the burden of their employees\u00d5 retirement costs.\n\nThey got a temporary tariff from President Bush, but not much more. And so the steel industry \u00d1 what was left of it \u00d1 shuddered and collapsed.\n\nBethlehem Steel, whose steel was used in the Hoover Dam, the Chrysler building and the George Washington Bridge, filed for bankruptcy in October 2001. It was followed by National Steel, Weirton Steel, Georgetown Steel and many others. The pain was great.\n\nAnd necessary, some say. \u00d2If the steel companies had gotten all they wanted in terms of loan guarantees and import quotas, they would never have gotten better,\u00d3 said Richard Fruehan, director of the Sloan Study on Competitiveness in the Steel Industry. \u00d2The bankruptcies forced their hand.\u00d3\n\nOver the decades the companies had shed employees to stay afloat. Soon retirees greatly outnumbered the actual workers. At Bethlehem, the ratio was six retirees for every worker. All these retirees had good pensions and good health care plans, which they thought were guaranteed. But these costs were a tremendous weight on the companies.\n\nBankruptcy changed the rules, allowing the steel makers to unload billions of dollars in pension obligations onto the government\u00d5s Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and to cut more than 200,000 workers from their supposedly guaranteed medical care."}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "Two federal agencies are stopping a contentious California project from fracturing bedrock miles underground and extracting its geothermal energy until a scientific review determines whether the project could produce dangerous earthquakes, spokeswomen for the Energy and Interior Departments said on Monday.\n\nAltaRock Energy has a permit pending to fracture bedrock and extract energy at its drilling site near Anderson Springs, Calif.\n\nThe project by AltaRock Energy, a start-up company with offices in Seattle and Sausalito, Calif., had won a grant of $6.25 million from the Energy Department, and officials at the Interior Department had indicated that it was likely to issue permits allowing the company to fracture bedrock on federal land in one of the most seismically active areas of the world, Northern California.\n\nBut when contacted last month by The New York Times for an article on the project, several federal officials said that AltaRock had not disclosed that a similar project in Basel, Switzerland, was shut down when it generated earthquakes that shook the city in 2006 and 2007. AltaRock officials denied the accusation, saying they had been forthcoming about the results of the Basel project.\n\nIn statements issued Monday in response to questions by The Times, the spokeswomen for the federal agencies said the new study would focus specifically on the lessons that the experience in Basel held for the AltaRock project, in a seismically active area known as the Geysers. Fracturing bedrock is sometimes referred to by specialists in geothermal energy as stimulation.\n\n\u00d2No stimulation activity will be funded by the department until we\u00d5ve completed this additional comparative analysis,\u00d3 said Stephanie Mueller, the Energy Department spokeswoman.\n\nJan Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Land Management at the Interior Department, said no permits for fracturing the rock at the drilling site would be issued until the Energy Department completed the study.\n\nThe new study by the Energy Department and its decision to withhold financing were first reported Monday by The Sacramento Bee.\n\nA senior official at AltaRock, James T. Turner, said the company had provided additional information to the Department of Energy.\n\nMr. Turner said, \u00d2Based on our current schedule, we don\u00d5t believe the D.O.E.\u00d5s process will impact our work or timetable.\u00d3\n\nJeff Gospe, the president of a community organization in Anderson Springs, Calif., a small town two miles from the AltaRock project, said the town would welcome the federal intervention.\n\n\u00d2The community will be relieved because, frankly, this thing was rushed through from the beginning, and we\u00d5d like to see greater study of this to be sure that things are done safely,\u00d3 Mr. Gospe said.\n\n\u00d2We\u00d5re obviously pleased that the Energy Department is taking into account all the stakeholders of this project and not just the geothermal industry,\u00d3 he added.\n\nThe area around the Geysers is already shaken by swarms of mostly small earthquakes set off by an extensive geothermal operation that drills into relatively shallow steam beds and extracts their heat to produce electricity.\n\nAltaRock plans to drill much deeper and for the first time fracture the hot underlying bedrock, then circulate water through the cracks and create more steam. The company maintains that the process will be safe and that its safeguards are more comprehensive than those that were in place for the Basel project.\n\nThe decision to study the two projects comparatively appears to indicate that federal officials were not satisfied with those assurances.\n\nAltaRock has also attracted large amounts of private venture capital for its energy projects. Companies including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and an arm of Google have invested some $30 million in the company."}

Hunt, the chairman and chief executive of Hunt Oil, in an undated photo.\n\nThe conclusions were based on e-mail messages and other documents that the committee released Wednesday.\n\nUnited States policy is to warn companies that they incur risks in signing contracts until Iraq passes an oil law and to strengthen Iraq\u00d5s central government. The Kurdistan deal, by ceding responsibility for writing contracts directly to a regional government, infuriated Iraqi officials. But State Department officials did nothing to discourage the deal and in some cases appeared to welcome it, the documents show.\n\nThe company, Hunt Oil of Dallas, signed the deal with Kurdistan\u00d5s semiautonomous government last September. Its chief executive, Ray L. Hunt, a close political ally of President Bush, briefed an advisory board to Mr. Bush on his contacts with Kurdish officials before the deal was signed.\n\nIn an e-mail message released by the Congressional committee, a State Department official in Washington, briefed by a colleague about the impending deal with the Kurdistan Regional Government, wrote: \u00d2Many thanks for the heads up; getting an American company to sign a deal with the K.R.G. will make big news back here. Please keep us posted.\u00d3\n\nThe release of the documents comes as the administration is defending help that United States officials provided in drawing up a separate set of no-bid contracts, still pending, between Iraq\u00d5s Oil Ministry in Baghdad and five major Western oil companies to provide services at other Iraqi oil fields.\n\nIn the no-bid contracts, the administration said it had provided what it called purely technical help writing the contracts. The United States played no role in choosing the companies, the administration has said.\n\nDisclosure of those contracts has provided substantial fuel to critics of the Iraq war, both in the United States and abroad, who contend that the enormous Iraqi oil reserves were a motivation for the American-led invasion \u00d1 an assertion the administration has repeatedly denied.\n\nIraq\u00d5s oil minister, Hussain al-Shahristani, has condemned the Kurdistan deal as illegal because it was not approved by Iraq\u00d5s central government and was struck without an oil law, which has still not been passed.\n\nAfter the deal was signed last year, a senior State Department official in Baghdad criticized it, saying, \u00d2We believe these contracts have needlessly elevated tensions between the K.R.G. and the national government of Iraq.\u00d3\n\nThe State Department said Wednesday that it had discouraged the deal. Hunt officials declined to comment, and Kurdish government officials said there was no impropriety.\n\nIn a letter to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, whose chairman is Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, a State Department official wrote that the department had strongly discouraged Hunt from signing the deal until an oil law had been passed.\n\nThe State Department told Hunt that \u00d2we continue to advise all companies that they incur significant political and legal risk by signing contracts\u00d3 before then, wrote Jeffrey T. Bergner, an assistant secretary for legislative affairs at the department, in one of the documents made public on Wednesday.\n\nBut in a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Waxman wrote that the documents his committee had collected \u00d2tell a different story about the role of administration officials.\u00d3 In letters obtained by the committee, Mr. Hunt informed the President\u00d5s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, of which he was a member, last July and August that he was pursuing serious business interests in Kurdistan.\n\n\u00d2We were approached a month ago by representatives of a private group in Kurdistan as to the possibility of our becoming interested in that region,\u00d3 Mr. Hunt wrote to the board last July 12. \u00d2We had one team of geoscientists travel to Kurdistan several weeks ago and we were encouraged by what we saw.\u00d3\n\nIn August 2007, Mr. Hunt informed State Department officials directly of his intentions in Kurdistan, and on Sept. 5, three days before the deal was signed, a flurry of e-mail messages among Hunt and State Department officials make clear that the department was aware of what was in the works."}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "Dr. Robert R. Wilson, a physicist who built the world's most powerful particle smashers in a setting that he insisted be surrounded by restored prairies and enriched by striking architecture and objects of art, died on Sunday at his home in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 85.\n\nWith a career that began in the 1930's, Dr. Wilson became one of the most important figures in the history of the development of particle accelerators, which smash subatomic particles together at high energy for the study of their interactions and composition.\n\nThough he was involved in numerous breakthroughs in physics research and accelerator design, perhaps his crowning achievement came when he led the design and construction of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in what was then farmland west of Chicago.\n\nFermilab, as it is known, began operating in 1972 as the most powerful accelerator in the world. And because of the futuristic technologies then embraced by Dr. Wilson, the laboratory has been able to increase its energy over the years and is expected to remain the world's most powerful until 2006, when it will be superseded by the Large Hadron Collider, an accelerator under construction at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.\n\nBesides his scientific achievements, Dr. Wilson was known for the environment he created at the Fermilab site, with hundreds of acres of restored prairie, a herd of bison, fishing holes, abstract sculpture and a central building modeled, in spirit at least, on the Beauvais Cathedral in France.\n\n''When he created Fermilab, it certainly had a style,'' said Dr. Leon M. Lederman, the Nobel Prize-winning particle physicist who succeeded Dr. Wilson as director of the laboratory. ''He was a showman in that sense; he took chances.''\n\nEnergy Secretary Bill Richardson said Dr. Wilson had had ''an unerring sense of what is important to the science of high-energy physics and its importance to the nation.''\n\nRobert Rathbun Wilson was born on March 4, 1914, in Frontier, Wyo. Though he tinkered with pumps and vacuum tubes as a boy, he apparently took plenty of time to enjoy the outdoors.\n\n''He always had big, wild tales about being a cowboy in Wyoming,'' said Dr. Dale Corson, a particle physicist and former president of Cornell University, who had known Dr. Wilson since the 1930's. ''Most of them turned out to be true.''\n\nDr. Wilson received a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Berkeley in 1936 and remained there for graduate school. His scientific style became clear early on, said Dr. Corson, who was also a student there at the time.\n\nDr. Corson said Ernest O. Lawrence, the legendary inventor of the particle accelerator called the cyclotron, assigned a problem in a Berkeley physics course that no student but Robert Wilson managed to solve. The problem involved finding the strength of the electric fields inside the cyclotron. While most of the students tried to perform difficult calculations to find the fields, Dr. Wilson quickly built a simplified model of a cyclotron in a physics laboratory and measured the electric fields.\n\n''That was his hallmark: a completely ingenious way of solving the problem,'' Dr. Corson said. ''And that carried right up to the Fermilab machine.''\n\nDr. Wilson went on to do research on the cyclotron with Lawrence before joining the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. He had stints at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Harvard before becoming the director of the Laboratory of Nuclear Studies at Cornell in 1947.\n\nWhile at Cornell, he did experiments on the structure of protons that were later explained by the theory that they are constituted of smaller particles called quarks, Dr. Lederman said.\n\nIn 1967, Dr. Wilson took a leave of absence from Cornell to become the founding director of Fermilab, where he left his mark as a brilliant designer of the powerful magnets necessary to confine the fast particles as they whirled around a giant ring.\n\nHe created the natural, architectural and artistic amenities in part to attract good scientists to the Illinois cornfields and in part because of an innate sense of aesthetics, said Dr. Boyce McDaniel, a longtime friend who is a retired Cornell physicist.\n\nDr. Wilson's design of the tunnel through which the particles raced at Fermilab included plenty of space to allow for technical improvements. That space came in handy when superconducting magnets, a powerful innovation that Dr. Wilson pushed to develop, were later installed, allowing the lab to boost its energy.\n\nHis dislike of bureaucracy was legendary and fit with his sometimes contrarian nature, said Dr. Michael Witherell, Fermilab's current director, who has a handwritten note from Dr. Wilson that reads in part: ''An all too common failing of large institutions is to fall into the bureaucratic morass -- complicated procedures, red tape and all that. That's terrible.''\n\nDr. Wilson is survived by his wife, Jane; three sons, Daniel, of Indianapolis, Jonathan, of Columbus, Ind., and Rand, of Boston; a sister, Mary Jane Greenhill of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.; and four grandchildren.\n\nDr. Wilson was known for completing huge projects ahead of schedule and below budget, but he resigned as director of Fermilab in 1978 because he did not believe that the government was financing it generously enough. He also once lectured a joint committee of Congress on why basic science was crucial even when it did not lead to instant practical benefits.\n\nAt the hearings, in 1969, Dr. Wilson's feistiness was most on display in an exchange with Senator John O. Pastore of Rhode Island. When Senator Pastore pressed Dr. Wilson on whether the knowledge gained at Fermilab would enhance national defense, Dr. Wilson said, ''It has nothing to do with defending our country, except to make it worth defending.''"}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "After nearly five years of covering the conflict here, I am leaving Iraq soon for a saner assignment. Having seen and felt more during those years than I can process or express for now, I am spending a lot of time trying to understand, really understand, why the Green Bay Packers let Brett Favre go to the Jets.\n\nI am a Packers fan from birth, and my father covered some of the great Lombardi teams as a TV sports anchor out of Madison, Wis., when I was in grade school. Vince Lombardi had what now might be called a Favre-like ability to awe and charm at the same time. At Dad\u00d5s first news conference in Green Bay, before he knew anyone with the team, Lombardi noticed the new guy 10 rows deep in the gallery and stepped off the podium to offer his hand and that big grin. He said, \u00d2I\u00d5m Vince Lombardi.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2Like I didn\u00d5t know,\u00d3 Dad said Sunday, when I phoned him from Baghdad to catch up and talk a little football. \u00d2I almost had to take out my driver\u00d5s license to tell him what my name was.\u00d3\n\nThe news conference was a first lesson in genuine star power. There would be many more for my father, Irv Glanz, as well as a few for me. But I hadn\u00d5t called him to talk about the old days; I wanted to tell him I\u00d5d watched the Jets beat the Bills on Sunday after years of not being able to see regular-season football games on satellite television in Baghdad.\n\nA colleague once likened reporting here to sending dispatches from Mars. Sunday was like watching the N.F.L. on Mars. Imagine sitting in a Mars lander on the endless dunes and watching Leon Washington take the ball from Favre and break off a 47-yard run for a touchdown as if he were the only player in a zero-gravity suit. At that moment, the remote and chilly reaches of the solar system all seemed to be friendly places, even if you were not really a Jets fan.\n\nIt was so much fun that I asked Mudhafer al-Husseini, an athletic young Iraqi in our newsroom, to stop by my office and watch some of the game. (As the Baghdad bureau chief for The Times, I run a compound of about 120 Iraqi translators, reporters, guards, drivers and other staff.) Mudhafer was at first distracted, because Sunday was the day an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at President Bush, and our Western correspondents were continuously calling Mudhafer\u00d5s cellphone to ask what it all meant.\n\nWhen his telephone had stopped ringing, Mudhafer said with classic Iraqi bluntness, \u00d2I never liked this game.\u00d3 He looked blankly at the screen as Favre faked a handoff and threw deep to David Clowney, who made an astonishing one-handed catch. A few plays later, Favre made one of his wild heaves downfield and was intercepted. Unmoved, Mudhafer said, \u00d2I like soccer and I can understand it.\u00d3\n\nBut the truth is, Mudhafer is a sports fan in the transcendent sense. I explained the rules and what was happening as the game went along, and by the time J. P. Losman fumbled and Shaun Ellis scored \u00d1 looking like a large man stumbling dangerously down a hill \u00d1 Mudhafer was jumping and yelling with me.\n\n\u00d2I like this game now, because it holds your breath!\u00d3 he said.\n\nIgnoring the broadcasters, Mudhafer also recognized immediately that the cameras were framing the game with Favre\u00d5s expressions: hands-on-hips chagrin when he threw the interception; lowered eyes on the sideline as Buffalo seemed close to running out the clock; and the leprechaun hops when Ellis lurched into the end zone.\n\nThat was another lesson of the Lombardi years, when his nervous pacing, plumes of agitated breath, Jovian scowls and big grin told you where the game stood. Stars on that scale could win you games, and they did, but they also gave you the characters you needed for your personal narrative of the contest. Those narratives, not the newspaper stories or the play by play, turn a team logo into an institution with a history and a right to belong in a certain time and place.\n\nThe distance from Mesopotamia to the Meadowlands, about 6,000 miles, brings with it a certain perspective. After Mudhafer left, the crawler at the bottom of the TV screen gave the last in a dismal progression of scores for the Packers-Jaguars game: a 20-16 Green Bay loss.\n\nI know that for the analytical minds of my profession, a final judgment on the Favre trade must wait for a range of subtleties involving the impending showdown with Chad Pennington and the Dolphins; the relative passer ratings of Favre and Aaron Rodgers, who is now under center for the Packers; and a million other factors. But in the Book of Titletown, the only thing that could possibly have justified forcing someone of Favre\u00d5s stature to leave for New York is an immediate and obvious swing in wins or some other stirring improvement.\n\nThe Packers, who went to the National Football Conference title game last year, are 5-9 and out of the playoffs. The Jets, who had four wins last year, are 9-5 and still in the hunt. This tells me that the football bureaucrats who let Favre go, and whose names I cannot keep straight over here, will see the wrath of the Packers\u00d5 gods \u00d1 Lombardi presiding \u00d1 come down on their helmetless heads. Soon.\n\nYou can read Homer to see how that one ends. In a less epic vein, on Sunday, Dad retold the story of buying expensive golf shoes just before a tournament for Wisconsin sportscasters and Packers players, then shooting well and having his choice of the prizes laid out on a table. They included a nice pair of golf shoes for which he had no use. \u00d2Vince came up and put his arm around me and said, \u00d4Irv, take the golf shoes,\u00d5 \u00d3 Dad said.\n\n\u00d2I took the golf shoes,\u00d3 he said."}

Paul Hastings, a military spokesman in Mosul.\n\nConcerns are growing that the campaign is succeeding in part because the insurgents have infiltrated the Iraqi security forces.\n\nThe recently deposed police chief in Mosul, Muhammad Kheiri Barhawi, whose force almost entirely deserted when the fighting began two weeks ago, was arrested Sunday by Kurdish forces in the province east of Mosul. A senior officer in the Mosul Police Department said Mr. Barhawi, found in possession of $600,000, was under investigation on suspicion of collaborating with insurgents.\n\nThree national guardsmen in Mosul were detained this week on suspicion of collaborating with insurgents, including one who was found helping insurgents who had set up an illegal checkpoint to identify other Iraqi troops, according to an American military commander here.\n\nFew details were available on Monday about the assassination of Sheik Muhammad Amin al-Faidhi, a member of a leading Sunni clerics association that had called for a boycott of the national parliamentary elections scheduled for Jan. 30.\n\nIn his lectures at Al Hadrah al Muhammadia mosque, Sheik Faidhi urged resistance against the American occupation but did not overtly call for armed conflict, according to an Iraqi who attended several of the lectures.\n\nWhile there were no prime suspects in the killing, Mosul has long been gripped by violence among religious and ethnic groups that share influence in the city, especially Kurds, and Sunni and Shiite Arabs.\n\nOne man who said he had witnessed the attack, Bashar Haseeb, said that the cleric had been shot by men in cars who sped away but that he was still alive after the attack. ''I went out to the street and saw the sheik in his religious costume, lying on the ground bleeding,'' Mr. Haseeb said. The sheik was taken to a hospital, where he died, he said.\n\nIn Baghdad on Monday, the American military announced that a soldier had died of wounds sustained during an attack in Baghdad the day before. Another soldier, from the First Cavalry Division, was shot in the head and killed by sniper fire on Monday while his convoy was stopped on the airport road in Baghdad, military officials said.\n\nFighting in Falluja continued to dwindle, as troops cleared houses in the city, finding three large weapons caches. Two American soldiers were wounded in attacks on Sunday, and one on Monday, with none killed in action, said Lt. Gen. John F. Sattler, the top Marine commander in Iraq.\n\nInsurgent attacks around the country have fallen sharply -- to about 90 a day from a high of around 150 a day as the battle in Falluja began, according to data compiled by a private security company. The overall trend since January, however, has been continuously upward. In southern Iraq, an attack around 9 a.m. severed the smaller of two pipelines running to the country's main export terminal in the Persian Gulf. ''The fact that there was an explosion indicates that foul play was involved,'' said an official at Iraq Pipeline Watch, which closely tracks the developments.\n\nA spokesman for Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most powerful Shiite cleric in Iraq, condemned a raid by Iraqi and American forces on a prominent Sunni mosque in Baghdad on Friday that killed at least three Iraqis. The raid, on the Abu Hanifa mosque, may have been an attempt to silence an imam who seemed to be calling for attacks on American and Iraqi security forces."}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "A photograph of a distant exploding star has given astronomers the first direct evidence that a mysterious ''negative gravity'' force swept through and still pervades the universe, scientists announced at a NASA news conference yesterday in Washington.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope by chance photographed the exploding star, the most distant ever observed, in 1997. Scientists say subsequent detective work on the relative intensity of its light confirms one of Einstein's conjectures about the universe: that all of space is bubbling with an invisible form of energy that creates a mutual repulsion between objects normally attracted to each other by gravity.\n\nEinstein himself thought the force, which he called the cosmological constant, was so strange that he later repudiated his conjecture. But the idea gained theoretical support in 1998 with findings suggesting that the expansion of the universe was accelerating and that the force accelerating the expansion, negative gravity -- the manifestation of the cosmological constant -- overtook the force of gravity in the last few billion years.\n\nThe new findings confirm that crucial part of the theory. And they rule out several competing explanations.\n\nBecause the amount of negative gravity in any given volume should be minuscule, its effects would not be felt in everyday life. But over vast distances involving huge volumes of space, the effect would be powerful enough to push galaxies and clusters of galaxies apart from one another.\n\nExploding stars, or supernovas, like the one that turned up unexpectedly on a photograph made by the Hubble telescope, can be excellent probes of those grand forces. The new observation is of a star that exploded about 11 billion years ago, when the universe was a quarter of its present age and when, scientists theorized, the cosmological constant, often called ''dark energy,'' was less powerful than gravity, the opposite of what prevails today.\n\nAs a result, the expansion of the universe was slowing at that time. This meant that the star was closer to earth when it exploded than it would have been if dark energy had dominated gravity then -- a fact discernable in its brightness. Astronomers said it was twice as bright as it would have been under competing theories about the universe.\n\nA team led by Dr. Adam G. Riess, an astrophysist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore analyzed the data. Dr. Riess, who worked with Dr. Peter E. Nugent of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said the measurement ''nails the existence of the dark energy.''\n\nDr. Michael S. Turner, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago not involved in the work, called the dark energy ''one of the most important discoveries in all of science.''\n\n''If Einstein were around today, he would get another Nobel Prize for his prediction of repulsive gravity,'' Dr. Turner said.\n\nHe added that research would now shift to a hunt for the source of the energy and efforts to observe many other distant supernovas to pin down the characteristics of the dark energy.\n\nThe universe is expanding as a legacy of its violent birth, which is believed to have occurred in a great explosion or ''big bang'' roughly 14 billion years ago. Until recently, scientists were all but certain that the gravitational attraction among the galaxies would slow the expansion.\n\nBut in 1998, two teams began presenting data on supernovas that they had observed as a way to measure the change in the expansion rate over the last few billion years. They used a class of supernovas that explode with nearly the same brightness each time, like bulbs of a known wattage. This constancy enabled scientists to measure the speed at which the expansion of the universe had swept these supernovas away: the dimmer they appeared from earth, the farther away they were.\n\nThose observations revealed unexpectedly dim supernovas, suggesting that something, perhaps clouds of cosmic dust, was obscuring them or that they were farther away than expected, perhaps driven away by an anti-gravity force.\n\nTo find the explanation, astronomers tried to observe objects so distant that their light had been traveling to Earth for billions of years.\n\n''You need things that you can see across to the other side of the universe,'' Dr. Nugent said.\n\nIf cosmic dust were dimming this light, they reasoned, the objects would be dimmer the farther they were from Earth. But if Einstein's explanation were correct, extremely distant supernovas should appear to brighten relative to some standard, rather than continuing to dim.\n\nBecause they are so faint and are obscured by Earth's atmosphere, very distant supernova explosions are rarely seen. But a break came in 1997 when teams led by Dr. Ronald L. Gilliland of the space telescope institute and Dr. Mark Phillips of the Carnegie Institution of Washington made long-exposure Hubble photographs of a tiny part of the sky. The pictures revealed a supernova in the distant gloom of space.\n\nA difficult and time-consuming analysis of light from the star showed that it was twice as bright as it would have been if cosmic dust had been obscuring it or, as another hypothesis held, if supernovas had somehow evolved steadily in brightness over the history of the cosmos.\n\nThe finding, said Dr. Saul Perlmutter, a physicist and supernova-hunter at the Berkeley laboratory not involved in the work, was ''not very consistent with simple dust or evolution models.''\n\n''That's the standout story here,'' Dr. Perlmutter said.\n\nCosmologists will have to cope with a universe that seems increasingly filled with mysterious stuff that scientists cannot see and do not fully understand. The dark energy joins dark matter as an invisible constituent of the cosmos.

{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "The Pentagon has done little to collect at least $100 million in overcharges paid in deals arranged by corrupt former officials of Kellogg Brown & Root, the defense contractor, even though the officials admitted much of the wrongdoing years ago, two senators have complained in a letter to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates.\n\nThe letter also said that the Army had almost completely failed to move away from the monopolistic nature of the logistics contract that has paid the contractor, now called KBR, $31.3 billion for logistics operations in Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan.\n\nThe New York Times obtained a copy of the letter, dated Friday, by the senators, Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, and Susan M. Collins, Republican of Maine. Senator McCaskill is chairman of a contracting oversight subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Senator Collins is the subcommittee\u00d5s ranking Republican.\n\nTheir letter is likely to revive allegations that the Pentagon has become so close to KBR, and relies so heavily on it, that there is little inclination or incentive to discipline the company, in response to either Congress or critics outside the government.\n\nIn 2007 the Army split the logistics contract, known as Logcap, in a way that allowed several companies to compete for each new need. The Army did this partly to avoid relying solely on KBR, whose pricing practices, even when technically legal, have sometimes received criticism as exorbitant. But the Army has seldom used the newly competitive arrangement.\n\nThe senators wrote that as of February, the latest date for which the subcommittee had received information, the Army had \u00d2not awarded a single task order for work in Iraq,\u00d3 the biggest source of logistics work.\n\nIn pressing for use of the new competitive arrangement, the senators cited 2008 legislation that calls for competition by multiple companies on military contracts unless there is \u00d2a compelling reason not to do so.\u00d3 The senators also brought up Congressional testimony by the Army\u00d5s chief of logistics that they said indicated the Army had no such compelling reason.\n\nReached for comment, Dan Carlson, a spokesman at the Army Sustainment Command in Rock Island, Ill., which administers the work, pointed out that under the new competitive arrangement, in which KBR, Fluor and Dyncorp submit bids, Fluor and Dyncorp have received some work in Afghanistan and Kuwait. Mr. Carlson said that the Army was working toward awarding work in Iraq under the new competitive arrangement.\n\nA spokeswoman for KBR, Heather L. Browne, said all of KBR\u00d5s logistics contracts have been won competitively. She added that \u00d2when KBR has discovered wrongdoing of any sort by an employee, we have swiftly reported it to the government,\u00d3 and said the company \u00d2in no way condones or tolerates illegal or unethical behavior.\u00d3 KBR itself has not been accused of wrongdoing in any of the cases of fraud by former employees.\n\nMs. Browne made clear that the company intended to continue its logistics work, saying KBR remained committed to high quality and to \u00d2engaging in a transparent and fact-based dialogue with the government.\u00d3\n\nThe letter and the Pentagon auditing documents that back up its conclusions are likely to be a point of discussion in Washington on Monday, when the Wartime Contracting Commission, a bipartisan legislative commission, is scheduled to meet on the logistics program, according to its Web site.\n\nTo the irritation of KBR\u00d5s critics, the Army has generally upheld the bills the company has submitted to the military, even when the Pentagon\u00d5s own auditors have questioned the amounts. But the argument that the Army was overcharged appears to be more clear-cut in the cases of several former KBR officials convicted of accepting bribes and kickbacks.\n\nIn those cases, the Army asked KBR to perform a certain task under the Logcap contract, like buying living trailers or building a dining facility, and the KBR officials found subcontractors in the region to carry out the actual work. The officials took bribes to steer the work toward subcontractors who were not the low bidders, or simply inflated the worth of the contracts once they had been awarded.\n\nIn the contracts handled by just one of those officials, Stephen Lowell Seamans, who pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy in March 2006, Pentagon auditors quickly found potential excess profits by a Kuwaiti subcontractor of $49.8 million, or 76 percent, \u00d2as a result of Mr. Seamans\u00d5s fraudulent activities,\u00d3 the senators wrote.\n\nOf $306 million in tainted contracts, at least $100 million of the charges appeared to be unjustified, wrote the senators."}

The definite termination date was also seen as helpful for planning future oversight efforts from Bush administration agencies, he said.\n\nBut in Congress, particularly on the Democratic side of the aisle, there have long been accusations that agencies controlled by the Bush administration are not inclined to unearth their own shortcomings in the first place.\n\nThe criticism came to a head in a hearing a year ago, when Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, an Ohio Democrat, induced the Pentagon\u00d5s acting inspector general, Thomas Gimble, to concede that he had no agents deployed in Iraq, more than two years after the invasion.\n\nA spokesman for the Pentagon inspector general said Thursday that Mr. Gimble had worked to improve that situation, and currently had seven auditors in Baghdad and others working on Iraq-related issues in the United States and elsewhere. Mr. Gimble was in Iraq on Thursday, the spokesman said.\n\nMr. Bowen\u00d5s office has 55 auditors and inspectors in Iraq and about 300 reports and investigations already to its credit, far outstripping any other oversight agency in the country.\n\nBut Howard Krongard, the State Department inspector general, said that the comparison was misleading, because many of those resources would probably flow to State and the Pentagon if Congress shuts Mr. Bowen\u00d5s office down.\n\n\u00d2I think we are competitive to do what they ask us to do,\u00d3 Mr. Krongard said, referring to Congress.\n\nMr. Kucinich and other lawmakers said that Iraq oversight could also be hurt by the loss of Mr. Bowen\u00d5s mandate, which allows him to cross institutional boundaries, while the other inspectors general have jurisdictions only within their own agencies. Mr. Krongard said that issue could be handled by cooperation among the inspectors general.\n\nOfficials at the State Department and the Pentagon made it clear that in general terms they supported Mr. Bowen\u00d5s work and would abide by the wishes of Congress.\n\nWhile the quality of Mr. Bowen\u00d5s work is seldom questioned, he is sometimes accused of being a grandstander who is too friendly with the news media. Mr. Bowen has responded that it is standard procedure to publicize successful investigations as a way of discouraging other potential wrongdoers.\n\nAmong the disagreements on the termination language in the defense authorization bill was exactly how much it would have shortened Mr. Bowen\u00d5s tenure. An amendment in the Senate version of the bill actually expanded the pot of reconstruction money his agents could examine.\n\nBecause the tenure of his office is calculated through a formula involving the amount of reconstruction money in that pot, the crafters of that amendment figured that it would have extended Mr. Bowen\u00d5s work until well into 2008 \u00d1 or longer if Congress granted further extensions.\n\nMr. Holly agrees that the Senate language would have expanded that pot of money, but he says that in the Republican staff\u00d5s interpretation of the formula, Mr. Bowen\u00d5s tenure would have run out sometime in 2007 whether the money was added or not.\n\nIn any case, as the bill came out of conference, the termination date of Oct. 1, 2007, was inserted, effectively meaning that Mr. Bowen would have to start working on passing his responsibilities to other agencies by early next year.\n\nCapitol Hill staff members said that after House Democratic objections were overridden, Senate conferees agreed to the provision in a bit of horse-trading: the amount of money Mr. Bowen could look at would be expanded, but only with the hard termination date.\n\nMr. Bowen himself declined to comment on the controversy surrounding his office, saying only that he was already working with the other inspectors general to develop a transition plan in accordance with the defense authorization act. \u00d2We will do what the Congress desires,\u00d3 Mr. Bowen said.

Portable phones, electronic hotel locks and Palm Pilots have replaced those vestiges of a clunkier age, creating an illusion of wireless mobility. In the process, people are becoming ever more dependent on the systole and diastole of the grid.\n\nAnd the grid is always there, thrumming with electronic life.\n\nExcept during blackouts. At 4:10:48, voltage sensors picked up a fleeting dip, lasting a mere two-tenths of a second, on the grid in New England, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. Whatever the glitch meant, technicians were unable to head off the problem, and the system shut down over eight states.\n\nJust as they did after major blackouts in the Northeast in 1959, 1961, 1965 and 1977, investigators are trying to figure out exactly what set off the avalanche of failure. In 1965, it was a faulty breaker on a single power cable just north of the Niagara Falls area. In 1977, it was a series of lightning strikes. But what all the failures had in common is that the grid ? complicated beyond full understanding, even by experts ? lives and occasionally dies by its own mysterious rules.\n\nThat is why the Blackout of 2003 is likely to become more than an occasion to bemoan some of the outdated technology employed by profit-sensitive utility companies or the inconvenience of returning to a darkened home.\n\nThe incomprehensible complexity of the grid comes with its own irreducible pathologies, experts say. The system brings power to every wall plug in the nation, but, increasingly as the scale of the grid grows, it can suddenly take away that power. And given the sensitivity of the grid to accidental power failures, the realization of what deliberate acts by terrorists could do is also raising new concerns.\n\n\"There's the paradox,\" said Edward Tenner, author of \"Why Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences\" and \"Our Own Devices: The Past and Future of Body Technology.\"\n\n\"The grid definitely makes life safer and more reliable,\" but when something does go wrong, \"we've seen that the dominoes can start to fall over a wider and wider area. So it's conceivable that the next time this happens that it could extend even farther.\"\n\nThat possibility is frightening on its own terms, given the universal reliance on electrical power. From video games to A.T.M.'s to desktop computers ? most of which didn't exist in earlier blackouts ? dead devices brought normal life to a stop across the afflicted region. But the sensitivity of the grid to power failures has much wider implications, since Americans ? and the citizens of the rest of the world ? seem to like technologies that give them an illusion of independence within a giant web.\n\nCellphones operate on a similar principle of connectivity. So do municipal water systems. So does the Internet. The list is increasingly long. And that is why some experts believe that what is beginning to look like a worldwide push for wildly interconnected technologies will have more and more serious days of reckoning, for which last week's blackout ? like the grid itself ? is an arrow to the future humanity can expect.\n\nIn effect, these experts say, technicians can put their fingers in the dike, but with more and more things to go wrong, no safeguard will ever be subtle or sophisticated enough. \"Just by the sheer complexity, adding one thing to another, larger and larger disturbances are going to occur,\" said Phillip F. Schewe, a physicist and writer who is preparing a book on the 1965 blackout. \"I know that sounds fatalistic,\" he conceded."}

Major demonstrations were staged in a number of Shiite areas of Baghdad, including Sadr City, the huge neighborhood that is Mr. Sadr\u00d5s base of power.\n\nAlthough Mr. Bush praised the Iraqi government for leading the fighting, it also appeared that the Iraqi government was pursuing its own agenda, calling the battles a fight against \u00d2criminal\u00d3 elements but seeking to marginalize the Mahdi Army.\n\nThe Americans share the Iraqi government\u00d5s hostility toward what they call rogue elements of the Mahdi Army but will also be faced with the consequences if the battles among Shiite factions erupt into more widespread unrest.\n\nThe violence underscored the fragile nature of the security improvements partly credited to the American troop increase that began last year. Officials have acknowledged that a cease-fire called by Mr. Sadr last August has contributed to the improvements. Should the cease-fire collapse entirely, those gains could be in serious jeopardy, making it far more difficult to begin bringing substantial numbers of American troops home.\n\nAlthough Sadr officials insisted on Thursday that the cease-fire was still in effect, Mr. Sadr has authorized his forces to fight in self-defense, and the battles in Basra appear to be eroding the cease-fire.\n\nDuring a lengthy speech at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton, Ohio, Mr. Bush praised Iraq\u00d5s government for ordering the assault in Basra and portrayed the battle as evidence that his strategy of increasing troop strength was bearing fruit.\n\n\u00d2This offensive builds on the security gains of the surge and demonstrates to the Iraqi people that their government is committed to protecting them,\u00d3 he said.\n\n\u00d2There\u00d5s a strong commitment by the central government of Iraq to say that no one is above the law.\u00d3\n\nMr. Bush also accused Iran of arming, training and financing the militias fighting against the Iraqi forces.\n\nMr. Bush spoke after three days of briefings with senior advisers and military commanders on the situation in Iraq and the options for reducing the number of American troops there beyond the withdrawals already announced. It was one in a series of speeches he has been giving to build support for his policy before Gen. David H. Petraeus, the senior commander in Iraq, testifies before Congress next month.\n\nIn a videoconference with the president on Monday, General Petraeus recommended taking up to two months to evaluate security in Iraq before considering additional withdrawals, officials said Monday.\n\nOn Thursday, medical officials in Basra said the toll in the fighting there had risen to about 100 dead and 500 wounded, including civilians, militiamen and members of the security forces. An Iraqi employee of The New York Times, driving on the main road between Basra and Nasiriya, observed numerous civilian cars with coffins strapped to the roofs, apparently heading to Shiite cemeteries to the north.\n\nViolence also broke out in Kut, Hilla, Amara, Kirkuk, Baquba and other cities. In Baghdad, where explosions shook the city throughout the day, American officials said 11 rockets struck the Green Zone, killing an unidentified American government worker, the second this week.\n\nAnother American, Paul Converse of Corvallis, Ore., an analyst with a federal oversight agency, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, died of wounds suffered in a rocket attack on Sunday, a spokeswoman for the agency said Thursday.\n\nThe Iraqi government imposed a citywide curfew in Baghdad until Sunday.\n\nThousands of demonstrators in Sadr City on Thursday denounced Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who has personally directed the Basra operation, and Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the Shiite cleric who leads the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, a political party that is a crucial member of the coalition keeping Mr. Maliki in power.\n\nThe Supreme Council\u00d5s armed wing, the Badr Organization, is one of the most powerful rivals of the Mahdi Army in Basra, where Shiite militias have been fighting among themselves for years to control neighborhoods, oil revenues, electricity access, the ports and even the local universities.\n\nThe third powerful element in the city is the Fadhila Party, which split from the Sadrists years ago and has its own militia. The three parties are expected to be rivals in the next round of provincial council elections, now scheduled for October. Many Sadr supporters pointed to those elections, and the possibility that their party might gain a majority of the seats, as a motivation for the Basra assault.\n\nThat assertion was rejected by Sadiq al-Rikabi, the prime minister\u00d5s political adviser, who said that the deteriorating security situation in Basra had left Mr. Maliki no choice but to act."}

In previous cases made public by the inspector general\u00d5s office or its partners in investigating cases of malfeasance involving the bailout, the figures have been substantially lower. In one case earlier this year, a man in Tennessee, Gordon Grigg, pleaded guilty to embezzling $11 million in his clients\u00d5 investment funds.\n\nCalls to Taylor, Bean & Whitaker were not returned. Merrie Tolbert, a spokeswoman for Colonial, which is based in Montgomery, Ala., but has more than a third of its assets in Florida, said the company had received a search warrant and was cooperating and staying open, with \u00d2business as usual.\u00d3\n\nBanking experts said the investigation seemed related to an arrangement set up by the Treasury Department that required Colonial to obtain at least $300 million in private investment before being granted a bailout. The goal, regulators said, was to raise the bank\u00d5s risk-based capital ratio to 12 percent by Sept. 30, to offset losses from loans tied mainly to real estate in Florida.\n\nIn April, the company announced that Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, with other investors, would provide the $300 million infusion. But on Friday, Colonial reported in its quarterly report that the deal was mutually terminated because regulatory approval could not be obtained.\n\nStanley D. Smith, a finance professor at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, said that Colonial was one of several southeastern banks that came into Florida during the building boom, only to regret it later. As of June 31, some 88 percent of Colonial\u00d5s loans were in real estate, Mr. Smith said, a high value that helps explain the bank\u00d5s losses.\n\nAs of last month, it had more than $1 billion in nonperforming assets, out of total assets of $26 billion. In the last quarter alone, the company, which has 4,500 employees, lost $606 million.\n\nTaylor, Bean and Whitaker has had its own troubles. In June, the company paid $9 million to settle with 14 states over questionable underwriting practices.\n\nBut the viability of Colonial may be a more urgent concern. Mr. Smith said it was likely that Taylor, Bean & Whitaker agreed to the investment on the condition that Colonial would be healthy with the new financing; the Treasury Department has maintained the same standard with its own cash infusions. This suggests that neither side believes that the bank can survive.\n\nEven bank officials no longer seem sure of the company\u00d5s future. Because of uncertainties about its ability to increase its capital levels, the company quarterly report said Friday, \u00d2management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about Colonial\u00d5s ability to continue as a going concern.\u00d3\n\nFor now, employees are trying to carry on.

{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "The Obama administration\u00d5s first major test of geothermal energy as a significant alternative to fossil fuels has fallen seriously behind schedule, several federal scientists said this week, even as the project is under review because of the earthquakes it could generate in Northern California.\n\nIntended to extract heat from hot bedrock, the project has been delayed because the bit on a giant rig, meant to drill more than two miles underground, has struggled to pierce surface rock formations, the scientists said.\n\nThe bit has snapped off at least once and become repeatedly fouled in a shallow formation called cap rock, and the drillers have twice been forced to pull it out and essentially start the hole over again.\n\nLate last year, the project, undertaken by a start-up company called AltaRock Energy, received $6.25 million in financing from the Energy Department, in hopes that it would be the first of dozens of projects to produce renewable energy by fracturing rock at the bottom of a deep hole and then circulating water through the cracks to generate steam.\n\nBut last month, after an article in The New York Times raised questions on whether AltaRock had been forthcoming about earthquakes generated by a similar project in Basel, Switzerland, the Energy Department and the Bureau of Land Management informed the company that it would not be allowed to fracture rock until the department completed a new review of whether the project would be safe. The company was allowed to keep drilling, however, down toward the depth at which it would begin the fracturing.\n\nThe scientists who told of delays in the project spoke only on the condition that they not be identified, in order to preserve their access to company progress reports. The scientists said that after nearly two months of the highly expensive drilling, the rig had reached depths of less than 4,000 feet. The original schedule called for it to reach a final depth of 12,000 feet, or 2.3 miles, after no more than 50 days of drilling, according to company officials.\n\nThe problems are particularly surprising given that the drilling essentially started at 3,200 feet, at the bottom of an older hole at the site, north of San Francisco at a place called the Geysers.\n\nThe company has also raised some $30 million in venture capital. Among AltaRock\u00d5s high-profile investors are Google and the investment firms Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.\n\nAdvocates for the technique, known as an \u00d2enhanced geothermal system,\u00d3 say it could eventually generate vast amounts of energy and reduce America\u00d5s dependence on fossil fuels. But the latest delays come as AltaRock awaits word on whether the federal government will allow the fracturing of rock at all.\n\nThe fracturing would be virtually guaranteed to induce earthquakes, which the company has said would be so small as to be nearly imperceptible but which local residents and some scientists fear could be larger. The project is in one of the world\u00d5s most seismically active areas.\n\nAlthough the Basel earthquakes caused only minor structural damage, they frightened many in the city and led to the shutdown of the project there. The Energy Department review, likely to be released in the next few weeks, is expected to compare the Basel and California projects and determine whether AltaRock\u00d5s effort is safe.\n\nThe department is \u00d2monitoring the progress of the drilling at the site and is examining the question of induced seismicity there as we weigh a final decision on the project,\u00d3 said a spokeswoman, Stephanie Mueller.\n\n\u00d2We continue to believe that enhanced geothermal systems have enormous potential to provide renewable baseload energy to heat and power homes and businesses,\u00d3 she said. The term \u00d2baseload energy\u00d3 is used to refer to sources essentially constant, like the heat in the earth\u00d5s crust, rather than intermittent, like wind and solar energy.\n\nAltaRock declined a request for comment on the status of its drilling. \u00d2Please be advised that our policy is not to comment on ongoing commercial operations,\u00d3 James T. Turner, the company\u00d5s senior vice president for operations, said in an e-mail message.\n\nAs it waits for the outcome of the Energy Department\u00d5s review, the company has repeatedly pledged to avoid what it calls serious mistakes committed by the Basel project. In particular, AltaRock has said that the Basel project drilled in the vicinity of a major known fault that, the company says, was responsible for a huge earthquake that devastated the city in 1356.\n\nBut scientists at the Swiss Seismological Service and other European institutions say the fault responsible for that earthquake has never been clearly identified, let alone localized beneath the geothermal project.\n\n\u00d2The Basel project did not drill into any known fault in the area,\u00d3 said Nicholas Deichmann of the Swiss Seismological Service. Most of AltaRock\u00d5s public statements about that project, he said, \u00d2are simply wrong.\u00d3\n\nIn response, a scientist on AltaRock\u00d5s project said its description of the geothermal effort in Basel was based on documents published by scientists both in and outside the project there."}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "THE overwhelming sense among politicians and intellectuals in the Middle East last week was that America's little chemistry experiment had blown up in its face. President Bush promoted democracy and free elections as his primary solution to the region's ills \u00d1 and when Hamas won in a landslide in the Palestinian elections, the president got results that could not have been more inimical to the interests of the United States and its ally, Israel.\n\nLike a powerful catalyst best handled with an eyedropper rather than a ladle, free and fair elections have recently unleashed political forces elsewhere in the region that can hardly be seen as friendly to the United States. The radical Muslim Brotherhood made major gains in Egypt's parliamentary elections, a Shiite clerical list allied with Iran won a plurality in Iraq and Hezbollah \u00d1 considered, like Hamas, a terrorist organization by the West \u00d1 surged in last year's elections in Lebanon.\n\nFrom one point of view, one that produces more than a few chortles in the Middle East, the United States has fallen victim to some grand law of unintended consequences. \"You might remember the saying, 'Beware of what you wish \u00d1 you might get what you want,' \" said Abdel Monem Said Aly, director of the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo, well aware that he was tossing a Western saying back in the direction it came. \"It's very much applicable,\" he said.\n\nBut the wider question, Mr. Aly acknowledged, is whether the long-term benefits of democracy are worth the immediate perils. Can it be fine-tuned so it fits each of the volatile and diverse countries of the Middle East? And can a shot of democracy, however jolting at first, be trusted in the end to seduce and tame the forces it has set loose?\n\nRight after the Palestinian elections, Mr. Bush praised the \"power of democracy\" but did not seem to fully accept the outcome in that case, saying that the United States would not deal with a political party that advocates the destruction of Israel, as Hamas does.\n\nThe president did not specifically rule out talking to a government of which Hamas is a part. Still, he did not sound entirely pleased that he had gotten what he wished for. And if democracy continues to produce results that are irksome to the United States, will other Americans call into question the export of their most glorious product, electoral democracy?\n\n\"In the short term, there may be people who think that pushing democracy is contrary to our interests,\" said Robert Pastor, a former American diplomat who is the director of the Center for Democracy and Election Management at American University in Washington.\n\nBut the choice of tamping down democratic movements once they get started does not really exist, said Mr. Pastor, who negotiated with Hamas to avoid violence during the first Palestinian elections in 1996. The United States would hardly be in the business of stopping a cycle of elections once they start. And the experience of Latin America shows that selectively trying to purge electoral slates of radical groups merely pushes them to carry out violent revolutions.\n\nThat is also essentially what happened when military-backed rulers in Algeria canceled parliamentary elections in 1992 after they were swept by the Islamic Salvation Front, an organization determined to govern by Islamic law. Tens of thousands of people died in the conflicts that followed. \"If Hamas had been excluded\" from the recent elections, Mr. Pastor said, \"they would have said that they have no other alternative to violence. And they would be right.\"\n\nIf the catalytic reaction set in motion by elections cannot be stopped once it starts, then a better solution may be to promote democracy in a way that is tailored to the most dangerous realities of each country. Marina Ottaway, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, divides countries into three categories that highlight what can most readily go wrong for Western interests when democracy is thrown into the mix in the Middle East and the wider Arab world."}

A copy of the report was posted online by Secrecy News, a publication of the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nThe 68,197 contractors \u00d1 many of them Afghans \u00d1 handle a variety of jobs, including cooking for the troops, serving as interpreters and even providing security, the report says.\n\nThe report says the reliance on contractors has grown steadily, with just a small percentage of contractors serving the Pentagon in World War I, but then growing to nearly a third of the total force in the Korean War and about half in the Balkans and Iraq. The change, the report says, has gradually forced the American military to adapt to a far less regimented and, in many ways, less accountable force.\n\nThe growing dependence on contractors is partly because the military has lost some of its logistics and support capacity, especially since the end of the cold war, according to the report. Some of the contractors have skills in critical areas like languages and digital technologies that the military needs.\n\nThe issue of the role of contractors in war has been a subject of renewed debate in Washington in recent weeks with disclosures that the Central Intelligence Agency used the company formerly known as Blackwater to help with a covert program, now canceled, to assassinate leaders of Al Qaeda. Lawmakers have demanded to know why such work was outsourced.\n\nThe State Department also uses contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan, although both the department and the C.I.A. have said they want to reduce their dependence on outside workers.\n\nResponding to the Congressional research report, Frederick D. Barton, a senior adviser to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said it was highly questionable whether contractors brought the same commitment and willingness to take risks as the men and women of the military or the diplomatic services.\n\nHe also questioned whether using contractors was cost effective, saying that no one really knew whether having a force made up mainly of contractors whose salaries were often triple or quadruple those of a corresponding soldier or Marine was cheaper or more expensive for the American taxpayer.\n\nWith contractors focused on preserving profits and filing paperwork with government auditors, he said, \u00d2you grow the part of government that, probably, the taxpayers appreciate least.\u00d3\n\nCongress appropriated at least $106 billion for Pentagon contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2003 through the first half of the 2008 fiscal year, the report says.\n\nThe report said the combined forces in Iraq and Afghanistan still had more uniformed military personnel than contractors over all: 242,657 contractors and about 282,000 troops as of March 31."}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": " A North Carolina man who was charged yesterday with accepting kickbacks and bribes as a comptroller and financial officer for the American occupation authority in Iraq was hired despite having served prison time for felony fraud in the 1990's.\n\nThe job gave the man, Robert J. Stein, control over $82 million in cash earmarked for Iraqi rebuilding projects.\n\nAlong with a web of other conspirators who have not yet been named, Mr. Stein and his wife received \"bribes, kickbacks and gratuities amounting to at least $200,000 per month\" to steer lucrative construction contracts to companies run by another American, Philip H. Bloom, an affidavit outlining the criminal complaint says. Mr. Stein's wife, who was not named, has not been charged with wrongdoing in the case; Mr. Bloom was charged with a range of crimes on Wednesday.\n\nIn the staccato language of the affidavit, filed in Federal District Court in the District of Columbia, Mr. Stein, 50, was charged with wire fraud, conspiracy, interstate transportation of stolen property and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nBut the list of charges does little justice to the astonishing brazenness of the accusations described in the complaint, including a wire transfer of a $140,000 bribe, arranged by Mr. Bloom, to buy real estate for Mr. Stein in North Carolina. The affidavit also says that $65,762.63 was spent to buy cars for Mr. Stein and his wife (he bought a Chevrolet; she a Toyota), $44,471 for home improvements and $48,073 for jewelry, out of $258,000 sent directly to the Bragg Mutual Federal Credit Union into accounts controlled by the Steins.\n\nMr. Stein's wife even used $7,151.58 of the money for a \"towing service,\" the complaint says. Much of this money was intended for Iraqi construction projects like building a new police academy in the ancient city of Babylon and rehabilitating the library in Karbala, the southern city that is among the holiest sites for Shiite Muslims.\n\nAfter Mr. Stein awarded contracts for this work to Mr. Bloom, who eventually received at least $3.5 million himself, according to the complaint, the work often was not performed or was done shoddily, the prosecutors say.\n\nMr. Stein was arrested in North Carolina on Monday, the Justice Department said in a statement. He appeared in court on Tuesday, represented by Jane Pearce, an assistant federal public defender in North Carolina's Eastern District, said Elizabeth Luck, a spokeswoman for the office. The Eastern District includes Fayetteville, where Mr. Stein is listed as a homeowner.\n\nBeyond confirming Mr. Stein's appearance in court, \"we do not comment on pending litigation in this office,\" Ms. Luck said, adding that she could not say whether Mr. Stein planned to retain a private lawyer.\n\nLittle is known about Mr. Stein except that he served in the Army and was convicted in federal court in 1996 for \"access device fraud,\" a felony. Court papers show he was sentenced to eight months in prison and ordered to pay $45,339.25 in restitution.\n\nMr. Stein's lawyer in that case was Richard B. Glazier, who was reached by phone at his home in Fayetteville. He could not recall the details of the case but said: \"I recall it being a fairly basic case; I don't recall there being any substantial publicity with it.\"\n\nThe affidavit yesterday alleges that on Jan. 22, 2004, Mr. Stein transferred $200 of money obtained through bribes to the clerk of United States District Court in North Carolina's Eastern District.\n\nThe payment, the affidavit explains, was an installment on the restitution payment that Mr. Stein had been ordered to pay on his earlier felony conviction.\n\nMr. Stein worked for the Grundy Marine Construction Company, based in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., in 2001 and 2002, said the company's vice president, Pete Caruk, in a telephone interview. Mr. Stein was fired when he was found to be falsifying payroll records and making out false invoices for nonexistent purchases of materials for a construction job at an Air Force base, Mr. Caruk said.\n\nThe company later found, Mr. Caruk said, that Mr. Stein had also falsified elements of his r\u008esum\u008e, like decorations he claimed to have won during his military service but had never received. The company lost about $1.5 million in the overbilling episode, and presented its case to the authorities, Mr. Caruk said, but Mr. Stein has not been prosecuted.\n\n\"This guy is a thief,\" Mr. Caruk said. \"He's a con artist and a crook.\""}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "For decades, when an item was lost or stolen, a consumer went through three stages of grief: anger, mourning and acceptance. You would be miffed, then sad and then you would move on, in large part because moving on was the only option.\n\nThen came the Digital Age and with it, gadgets that manufacturers can keep tabs on \u00d1 and even profit from \u00d1 when they wind up in the hands of someone who has found or poached them. Which, in turn, has led to a fourth stage of gadget-related grief: rage.\n\nSpecifically, rage at the gadget makers, which often know exactly who has a missing or stolen device, because in many instances it has been registered to a new user.\n\nBut many tech companies will not disclose information about the new owners of missing devices unless a police officer calls with a search warrant. Even a request to simply shut down service \u00d1 which would deter thieves by rendering their pilfered gadget useless \u00d1 is typically refused.\n\nThe problem, which nobody had to deal with before smartphones and satellite radios, has reached new heights with the Kindle reader from Amazon, with its ability to download books wirelessly and store hundreds of titles on a single device.\n\nOn Web sites devoted to the e-book reader, including Blog Kindle and Amazon\u00d5s own Kindle Community board, many customers have been in a snit over Amazon\u00d5s policy on stolen Kindles.\n\nSamuel Borgese, for instance, is still irate about the response from Amazon when he recently lost his Kindle. After leaving it on a plane, he canceled his account so that nobody could charge books to his credit card. Then he asked Amazon to put the serial number of his wayward device on a kind of do-not-register list that would render it inoperable \u00d1 to \u00d2brick it\u00d3 in tech speak.\n\nAmazon\u00d5s policy is that it will help locate a missing Kindle only if the company is contacted by a police officer bearing a subpoena. Mr. Borgese, who lives in Manhattan, questions whether hunting down a $300 e-book reader would rank as a priority for the New York Police Department.\n\nHe began to see ulterior motives when he twice sent e-mail messages to Amazon seeking an address to send a police report and got no reply.\n\n\u00d2I finally concluded,\u00d3 Mr. Borgese said, \u00d2that Amazon knew the device was being used and preferred to sell content to anyone who possessed the device, rather than assist in returning it to its rightful owner.\u00d3\n\nDrew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said only that the company acted in accordance with the law and cooperated with law enforcement officials. \u00d2Beyond that, we aren\u00d5t going to speculate on hypotheticals,\u00d3 he wrote in an e-mail message.\n\nThe complaints have left Amazon with a new public relations dilemma. In July, when Amazon remotely deleted titles from Kindles, citing copyright reasons, it was accused of heavy-handedness. If the company were to shut down a Kindle that had been erroneously reported as stolen, it might be accused of playing cop, judge and jury. Then again, it is also possible that Amazon is simply avoiding the financial burden of adjudicating claims.\n\nWhatever the reasoning, Amazon\u00d5s policy is hardly unique.\n\nSirius XM Radio also says it needs to see a subpoena from a police officer before it will deactivate or hand over information about missing radios. Patrick Reilly, a company spokesman, said the goal was \u00d2to protect the original subscriber who has lost the radio, but also not to incriminate someone who legitimately comes in possession of a radio.\u00d3\n\nRadios that have been reported stolen, he added, are reactivated only after someone provides a \u00d2proof of purchase,\u00d3 like a receipt from eBay.\n\nBut former customers who have inquired about the fate of their stolen radios have been dismayed at how little company representatives are willing to help.\n\n\u00d2I still don\u00d5t understand why they couldn\u00d5t just notify the police department and tell them who has my radio,\u00d3 said Dolly Richards of Kennewick, Wash., whose Sirius radio was plucked from a Chevy Blazer one recent Sunday morning. \u00d2I mean, there\u00d5s a whole police report about this break-in. They can\u00d5t call and say, \u00d4So and so just registered that radio\u00d5 \u00d3?\n\nIPhone owners have a number of options to search for their handsets, including features that use GPS technology to send out virtual semaphores. But if someone can shut down or elude those systems, and if the phone\u00d5s security identity module \u00d1 a k a the SIM card \u00d1 is replaced, it can be used by its new owner to make calls.\n\n\u00d2When we address lost or stolen iPhones,\u00d3 says Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&T, which has exclusive rights to the iPhone in the United States, \u00d2all we\u00d5re focused on is preventing any charges from accruing to that account. We don\u00d5t disable the phone.\u00d3\n\nThe approach of American tech companies is not shared by some of their counterparts abroad, which seem more willing to intervene.\n\nIn England, for example, the major cellphone players keep a centralized black list for mobile phone serial numbers, allowing consumers to flag lost or stolen phones so they cannot be re-registered.\n\nThere is nothing like that in the United States. John Walls, a spokesman for the CTIA, the wireless industry\u00d5s trade group, says that is because carriers here subsidize the cost of new phones, and as a result phones are so inexpensive here that theft is not a significant problem.\n\nIn Canada, it is the policy of Sirius Satellite Radio, an affiliated but separate company from Sirius XM, to deactivate a radio if a subscriber signs a statement that the radio has been stolen and asks the company to cease providing service to it. A spokesman said that was simply how the company had handled the matter since its start in 2005 and it seemed to work.\n\nMr. Borgese, who once ran a software company, says gadget makers in the United States have high-tech solutions to this high-tech problem. Amazon, he said, simply needs another step in the registration process for secondhand Kindles.\n\nBefore a resold device could function, an e-mail message would be sent to the original owner, saying, in effect, \u00d2Click here to acknowledge that you\u00d5ve sold your Kindle.\u00d3\n\nWhen asked for an opinion on Mr. Borgese\u00d5s idea, Amazon\u00d5s spokesman declined to comment."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "ON the TV screen, a 30-ish guy is lounging in bed, talking on the phone, with an older woman curled up near his arm.\n\n\u00d2Dude, there is no way your mom is cheating on your dad,\u00d3 he says.\n\n\u00d2That wasn\u00d5t Jay, was it?\u00d3 the woman asks, once the guy has hung up.\n\n\u00d2Yeah, that was your son. Don\u00d5t worry, he\u00d5s not going to find out.\u00d3\n\nFreeze frame, and cue the narrator: \u00d2You think that\u00d5s low? Spirit Airlines fares are even lower.\u00d3\n\nSubtle? No. Outrageous? Sure.\n\nBut Spirit seems to relish the outrageous. Originally a charter company that ferried passengers from the Midwest to Atlantic City, the privately held company has, since 2006, been taking the ultra-low-cost, \u0088 la carte approach to air travel to places it\u00d5s never been, at least in this country.\n\nSpirit\u00d5s specialty is the supercheap ticket from a major American city to vacation spots like Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, and it\u00d5s ideal for people spontaneous enough to jump on last-minute sales, sometimes for tickets that cost as little as $9, one way.\n\nBut consider yourself warned: Spirit unabashedly contends that its only obligation to customers is getting them safely from Point A to Point B. Everything else is extra. And like its European inspiration, Ryanair, the company takes the word \u00d2nonrefundable\u00d3 very literally. There is no excuse, plea or tap dance that will save you from the $110 change fee if you miss your plane.\n\nNot surprisingly, a lot of people find this \u00d1 there is no other word \u00d1 outrageous. Given that Spirit flies about seven million people a year, just one-tenth of the traffic handled by a traditional airline like United, it has inspired an amazing amount of online venting, to the Department of Transportation and on Web sites like consumeraffairs.com.\n\nMost of it is from Spirit fliers who were charged fees they say they didn\u00d5t see coming, or couldn\u00d5t get refunds they thought they deserved, or who had to buy new tickets on different airlines when Spirit flights were canceled. (Spirit typically will offer to put you on its next plane, but if that plane doesn\u00d5t arrive for another day, and you need to leave that night, the response occasionally translates as, \u00d2Your problem, not ours.\u00d3)\n\nIs this, as they say, any way to run an airline?\n\nYes it is, says Ben Baldanza, 47, Spirit\u00d5s chief executive. A short, genial guy with wire-rimmed glasses and a big smile, Mr. Baldanza has one of those naturally booming voices that suggests he\u00d5s giving a speech in a banquet hall, even when his audience is two feet away. One recent afternoon, he sat at a round table in his office here, in a generic-looking industrial park about 25 minutes northwest of Miami, and explained his rather pitiless approach to cost-cutting and complaining passengers \u00d1 particularly those who he believes have nothing to complain about.\n\n\u00d2We know that frustrations about Spirit exist,\u00d3 he says. \u00d2To some extent, it\u00d5s about a mismatch of expectations. For years, in this industry, if you whined, we gave you something. You yell, we waive a fee. That\u00d5s created a general expectation that airlines will break their own policies \u00d1 and we don\u00d5t.\u00d3\n\nYou can tell that Mr. Baldanza gets a kick out of such tough-love pronouncements, and he isn\u00d5t bothered by the occasional bouts of Internet battering he has endured over the years. Most notably, there was the time in 2007 when he accidentally hit \u00d2reply all\u00d3 to an e-mail message from a customer demanding a refund for a flight after a delay caused him to miss a concert in Atlanta \u00d1 as well as money for the hotel and show. \u00d2We owe him nothing as far as I\u00d5m concerned,\u00d3 Mr. Baldanza wrote in his response, which turned up on many blogs. \u00d2Let him tell the world how bad we are. He\u00d5s never flown us before anyway and will be back when we save him a penny.\u00d3\n\nIn flusher times, it\u00d5s unlikely that anyone would talk about Spirit as a harbinger of the American airline business. But last week, the International Air Transport Association predicted that a decline in demand would lead to an industrywide loss of $4.7 billion in 2009.\n\nAnd last year, as high fuel prices helped shut down some small airlines and nearly bankrupted a few large ones, Aviation Daily reported that in the second quarter of 2008, Spirit had the highest operating margins and lowest unit cost of any American carrier. (Even with those margins, Spirit ended up losing $16 million last year, an improvement over the $78 million loss it sustained in 2006. It barely broke even in 2007.)\n\nBy performing in a way that could be described as not horrible, all things considered, Spirit could become more of an industry model during the downturn, some analysts say."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "Last month, for the first time in its 37-year history, this media-shy company allowed a reporter to visit what is officially called the Ruby Tuesday Support Services Center, here in Maryville, just south of Knoxville. It\u00d5s a modern, three-building complex, with more than 35,000 square feet of cubicles, classrooms, test kitchens and roughly 370 very cheerful employees. If you have always assumed that every casual chain restaurant has a nerve center and idea laboratory, you\u00d5re right \u00d1 and this is what it looks like.\n\nThe chain is keeping some menu staples, like the ribs that Anthony Barbaretti ordered in Maryville, Tenn. \n\nA group of chefs work on the first floor in the main building, confecting and painstakingly market-testing the next \u00d2craveable,\u00d3 as standout dishes are known. And the company is stepping up its already extensive training program, called Wow-U, flying in managers weekly from across the country and preaching an astoundingly detailed catechism of rules, etiquette and sales tactics known as \u00d2the Ruby Way.\u00d3\n\nThe trick is for the company to elevate its image without alienating those customers who actually liked the dowdier original. Mr. Beall, a supremely confident man, sounds unworried.\n\n\u00d2We lost about 5 percent to 8 percent of our base by upgrading, mostly at lower income levels,\u00d3 he says with a shrug. \u00d2Very few people miss the roller skates on the wall and the bad food.\u00d3\n\nPAT PETERSON is teaching \u00d2Service Engagement\u00d3 in front of about 60 Ruby Tuesday managers. Like a lot of the lecturers here, he\u00d5s been with the company for more than a decade; he started as a part-time cook and is now director of quality and innovation.\n\nMr. Peterson has boundless energy, and he paces back and forth in front of his students \u00d1 most of them men in their 30s and 40s \u00d1 shouting and gesticulating like a TV pitchman selling a Miracle Mop. He is recounting a night when two guys came into a Ruby Tuesday wearing Budweiser trucker hats. A waitress approached and asked something foolish: Want to try the sangria?\n\n\u00d2What did the Budweiser brothers want?\u00d3 Mr. Peterson shouts at the class.\n\n\u00d2Bud,\u00d3 the class replies in improvised unison.\n\n\u00d2A cold beer, right! They couldn\u00d5t have been more clear about that if they walked in with a buzzing neon sign that said \u00d4Give me a Budweiser!\u00d5 If you want to get really frisky you might have sold them up to a Sam Adams handcrafted draft or something like that, but I wouldn\u00d5t have gone anywhere near sangria. Because these are not sangria people.\u00d3\n\nHis audience nods.\n\n\u00d2And when I approach that table with sangria, then I\u00d5m making clear from the very beginning, this is about me winning a contest or my manager is bugging me about selling sangria, or whatever it is. \u00d4Hey, I don\u00d5t care what you want. I\u00d5m going to nudge you to what I think you need.\u00d5\n\n\u00d2Does that make sense to everybody?\u00d3\n\nClass: \u00d2Yes.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2Is it something we want to be doing?\u00d3\n\nClass: \u00d2No.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2Is it something we\u00d5re doing every day?\u00d3\n\nClass: \u00d2Yes.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2Exactly! And we\u00d5re going to have to break out of that.\u00d3\n\nWhen people say the restaurant business is tough, they are usually referring to the challenge of running only a single restaurant. So how do you run 896? And how do you run 896 as you trade up virtually every protocol, ingredient and recipe, not to mention the uniforms, cutlery and ambience?\n\nNow add this wrinkle: Ruby Tuesday employs 43,000 people, and its annual rate of turnover is currently 100 percent. That doesn\u00d5t mean that everyone leaves in a given year; many of the managers stay for a long time. But there\u00d5s enormous churn on the rungs below.\n\n\u00d2And 100 percent, that\u00d5s really good,\u00d3 says Robert LeBoeuf, whose Ruby Tuesday title is chief people manager. \u00d2Three years ago, we were at 135 percent.\u00d3\n\nThis rotating staff must be tightly managed, but it is never supposed to sound overly scripted. As with every casual dining chain, Ruby Tuesday embraces the upside of fast-food uniformity (identical meals, no matter which restaurant you visit), but wants none of its downsides (a sense of prefab cooking that is delivered by programmed servers).\n\nSo while the company has thick orientation and training manuals, the point of Wow-U is not to rehash the regulations. It\u00d5s to acquaint managers with the art of improvising within those regulations, so they can teach underlings to do likewise."}

The others are \u00d2Nine,\u00d3 a film version of the Broadway musical, starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Pen\u008elope Cruz. There\u00d5s also \u00d2Halloween II\u00d3 and an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy\u00d5s post-apocalypse bummer, \u00d2The Road,\u00d3 starring Viggo Mortensen. For some of these films, \u00d2Inglourious\u00d3 among them, the brothers had to bring in partners to split production and promotion expenses, which means they\u00d5ll split profits, too.\n\nWill these guys be around to shepherd all these movies into theaters? The question has the sort of final-reel drama that the Weinsteins, in other circumstances, might savor. What\u00d5s certain is if there aren\u00d5t a few blockbusters in the near future, these guys are going to have to find new jobs.\n\nOf course, rivals and reporters have issued dire predictions like that throughout the Weinsteins\u00d5 career. But there\u00d5s a difference. This time, it\u00d5s a Weinstein making the prediction.\n\n\u00d2The ship\u00d5s riding on the slate,\u00d3 Harvey says, sounding remarkably buoyant, all things considered. \u00d2If by February, when we release \u00d4Hoodwinked 2\u00d5 \u00d3 \u00d1 he playfully thumps a hand on the table, dramatizing the sound of failure \u00d1 \u00d2I\u00d5ll be driving you, or making cheap hamburgers, or selling trailers, or refrigerators, or something. If the slate works, we\u00d5re right back to plan.\u00d3\n\nTHE Weinsteins \u00d1 Harvey is 57 year old, Bob is 54 \u00d1 will not discuss how much money they have left in the bank, but just calling up and asking for an interview, you could get the impression they\u00d5re running low. A few years ago, you\u00d5d barely have the receiver off your ear before public relations specialists would call to vigorously frisk you about your intentions. Your request for a sit-down would initially be denied, but if you persisted, you would eventually be summoned to Harvey\u00d5s office, where he would praise your work and offer you some goodie \u00d1 a book deal, for instance \u00d1 if you wrote about something else.\n\nNot now. The Weinstein Company doesn\u00d5t keep the same phalanx of P.R. pros on retainer, lost perhaps in a downsizing that included an 11 percent staff cut last year. Once you get into Harvey\u00d5s office, the most you can expect by way of enticing offers these days is a well-brewed cup of coffee.\n\nThat said, the brothers were downright generous with me when it came to screening their coming movies. In fact, they shared as much of their slate as was ready \u00d1 six movies in all, as well as ads, DVDs and rough cuts of unfinished products.\n\nThe goal, they said, was to demonstrate the strength of these films. For Harvey, it also seemed as if the screenings were supposed to bolster his case if \u00d1 or, perhaps in his mind, when \u00d1 he had to complain about this article. We showed him everything and he still said we\u00d5re doomed, was the subtext. If there is such a thing as prevenge, this is it.\n\n\u00d2You see this?\u00d3 Harvey asks, pounding a finger against a sheet of paper. It\u00d5s a Nielsen NRG tracking poll, a gauge of public interest in coming movies. He points to figures besides \u00d2Inglourious Basterds.\u00d3 Here\u00d5s the G-rated version of what he says next: \u00d2This is called \u00d4smash hit\u00d5!\u00d3\n\nBehold the charming Harvey, a plumpish, easily excited man with ink-dark eyes, two days\u00d5 worth of facial stubble and a trace of a New York accent. He is self-deprecating, chatty and usually in a rush. He has about him that magnetic field of charisma that you recognize as soon as you pass through his orbit.\n\nHappily, we won\u00d5t meet the irate Harvey, but those who have encountered him describe a combustible, thin-skinned creature who belongs in the Extreme Mammals exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History. In Hollywood, he is known for outbursts that elevate profanity and rage to a kind of performance art. He says that age, his daughters from a first marriage, and his second wife, the 33-year-old British clothing designer Georgina Chapman, have mellowed him. But even after decades at the epicenter of the film business, he and his brother seem to consider themselves gatecrashers at a party where everyone wonders how they got past the bouncer. They tend to believe that many people are rooting for their demise \u00d1 reporters in particular."}

Here is one on the mind of some Buffett watchers: When are you going to fix Moody\u00d5s?\n\nWarren E. Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway, is known for criticism of Wall Street, and of his own performance.\n\nMr. Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha, owns a stake of roughly 20 percent in the Moody\u00d5s Corporation, parent of one of the three rating agencies that grade debt issued by corporations and banks looking to raise money. In recent months, Moody\u00d5s Investors Service and its rivals, Standard & Poor\u00d5s and Fitch Ratings, have been prominent in virtually every account of the What Went Wrong horror story that is the financial crisis.\n\nThe agencies put their seals of approval on countless subprime mortgage-related securities now commonly described as toxic. The problem, critics contend, is that the agencies were paid by the corporations whose debt they were rating, earning billions in fees and giving the agencies a financial incentive to slap high marks on securities that did not deserve them.\n\nAt least 10 of the big companies that failed or were bailed out in the last year had investment-grade ratings when they went belly up \u00d1 like deathly ill patients bearing clean bills of health.\n\nMoody\u00d5s rated Lehman Brothers\u00d5 debt A2, putting it squarely in the investment-grade range, days before the company filed for bankruptcy. And Moody\u00d5s gave the senior unsecured debt of the American International Group, the insurance behemoth, an Aa3 rating \u00d1 which is even stronger than A2 \u00d1 the week before the government had to step in and take over the company in September as part of what has become a $170 billion bailout.\n\nMr. Buffett, 78, one of the world\u00d5s richest men, is known for piquant and unsparing criticism of his own performance, as well as the institutional flaws of Wall Street.\n\nBut on the subject of the conflict of interest built into the rating agencies\u00d5 business model, Mr. Buffett has been uncharacteristically silent \u00d1 even though that conflict is especially glaring in his case because one of the companies that Moody\u00d5s rates is Berkshire. (Its Aaa rating, for the record, is the same as the one from Standard & Poor\u00d5s. Fitch downgraded Berkshire for the first time last week.)\n\nMr. Buffett also seems to have said nothing about a problem that some contend is just as serious and endemic: because ratings are required in so many transactions, the agencies\u00d5 inaccurate ratings have no effect on their own bottom lines. And a company that is paid regardless of its performance is a company that will eventually underperform, says Frank Partnoy, a professor of law at the University of San Diego.\n\n\u00d2Imagine if you had a rabbi and said, \u00d4All the laws of kosher depend on whether this rabbi decides if food is kosher or not,\u00d5 \u00d3 says Mr. Partnoy, a former derivatives trader. \u00d2If the rules say \u00d4You have to use this rabbi,\u00d5 he could be totally wrong and it won\u00d5t affect the value of his franchise.\u00d3\n\nThe rating agencies have been mislabeling the goods for a long time. \u00d2A lot of investors have been eating pork recently,\u00d3 Mr. Partnoy says, \u00d2and they\u00d5re not too happy about it.\u00d3\n\nMr. Buffett declined to be interviewed for this article. Of course, he has bigger problems on his mind than a company that makes up less than $2 billion of his $127 billion empire.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate he has run for decades, recently reported its worst year ever: in the fourth quarter, net income fell 96 percent to $117 million.\n\nShort-selling Berkshire Hathaway has recently become a popular strategy, according to a report in Bloomberg News. But betting against Mr. Buffett has never been a profitable strategy in the long term, and the company\u00d5s class A shares, which now trade at about $82,000, way off the 52-week high of $147,000, look tempting to many analysts.\n\nJustin Fuller, a partner at Midway Capital Research and Management and author of the blog Buffetologist, says that anyone buying shares of Berkshire now is essentially buying the company at its 2004 price and getting everything that Mr. Buffett acquired since then gratis.\n\n\u00d2During the dot-com boom everyone said the old man had lost his touch, because he said he wouldn\u00d5t invest in technology companies,\u00d3 Mr. Fuller says. \u00d2When all the brick-and-mortar stock valuations improved, he was lauded as a genius again. He\u00d5s able to recognize these manias and waits for the world to go crazy, then comes in as lender of last resort and scoops up assets on the cheap.\u00d3\n\nMr. Buffett has been scooping. In the last year, he dipped into his multibillion-dollar war chest and also sold some shares in a variety of companies to add to his holdings, which now include preferred shares of Goldman Sachs and General Electric, each of which pays Berkshire 10 percent annually on its investment.\n\nBut he has also made an ill-timed deal to buy shares of ConocoPhillips and he acquired two Irish banks that have fared poorly, decisions he describes in his annual letter as a few of the \u00d2dumb things\u00d3 he did in 2008. He does not say much about his stake in Moody\u00d5s, and close readers of his letters say he has a history of highlighting some errors in order to obscure subjects he would rather not discuss.\n\n\u00d2Warren deserves credit for his candor in admitting mistakes,\u00d3 says Alice Schroeder, author of \u00d2The Snowball,\u00d3 a biography of Mr. Buffett. \u00d2But he chooses which mistakes to discuss. It also pays to listen for the \u00d4dog that didn\u00d5t bark.\u00d5 \u00d3\n\nOne of those nonbarking dogs, she says, is Moody\u00d5s."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "NOW that Gov. David Paterson of New York has completed his operatic quest to fill Hillary Clinton\u00d5s Senate seat and Roland Burris, chosen by the embattled Illinois governor to succeed Barack Obama, has made it past Capitol Hill security, we can safely conclude that appointing senators might not be such a good idea.\n\nActually, Americans came to that conclusion in 1913, when the 17th Amendment mandated regular senatorial elections. Reformers pushed the amendment as an antidote to the inevitable cronyism that surrounded the selections. In essence, however, it just allowed governors to pick replacements, as opposed to state legislatures.\n\nThe very problems the amendment was meant to address persist. Consider this: Nearly a quarter of the United States senators who have taken office since the 17th Amendment took effect have done so via appointment. Once Representative Kirsten Gillibrand, Mr. Paterson\u00d5s choice, joins the Senate, she will be one of more than 180 senators named by governors since 1913.\n\nBy contrast, the Constitution mandates special elections for all vacancies in the House \u00d1 even though representatives are far less powerful than senators.\n\nYet only a handful of states routinely fill vacated Senate seats by special election. The result is a tyranny of appointments.\n\nThis is bad for the legislature, and the constituents. Even when appointments are not explicitly put up for sale, a governor\u00d5s deliberations are surely informed by political expediency and personal ambition. (It would be impossible to look at the New York debacle and not think otherwise.) And even when the process is explicitly political and maybe even corrupt, as appears to be the case in Illinois, it seems as if there\u00d5s not a lot anyone can do about it. After all, the Illinois Legislature was unable to wrest power from Gov. Rod Blagojevich to force a special election.\n\nThere\u00d5s much talk of a \u00d2change agenda\u00d3 in Washington these days. We would do well to add another item to the list: We should stop letting governors appoint senators.\n\nLast year, I sponsored legislation in Rhode Island to require vacancy elections for the United States Senate. Congress should now step in and push all states to do the same. Though Congress\u00d5s power to force special elections is untested, it could surely create incentives for putting them in place \u00d1 or push for another constitutional amendment.\n\nIf Congress won\u00d5t act, the states should move forward on their own. Special elections have their difficulties \u00d1 among them, clogged fields of candidates and time-consuming and expensive runoffs.\n\nBut these challenges are surmountable. Instant runoff voting, which compresses runoffs into general elections by having voters rank candidates in order of preference, is one solution.\n\nAnd, as we\u00d5ve learned in Illinois and New York, elected officials provide a lot more hope for genuine democracy than their gubernatorially appointed alternatives."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "THERE will be admirers of Floyd Abrams, the most famous First Amendment lawyer in the country, who are surprised to learn that he represents a corporation widely regarded as Part of the Problem in the economic meltdown. These people are likely to have a passing familiarity with Mr. Abrams\u00d5s four-decade career and think of him as a tribune of free speech and a defender of underdogs.\n\nFloyd Abrams is representing S.&P. at a crucial moment, when many people fault rating agencies as signing off on junk.\n\nMr. Abrams has some advice for these admirers: Get over it.\n\n\u00d2People sometimes have views of what side of issues I should be on that have little to do with reality,\u00d3 he says. \u00d2I don\u00d5t spend my life simply working for the A.C.L.U.\u00d3\n\nFor much of the foreseeable future, the famous eloquence and pugnacity of this 73-year-old titan of the bar will serve Standard & Poor\u00d5s, the largest of the credit rating agencies. The company, along with its rivals, Moody\u00d5s and Fitch, stamped high grades on billions of dollars of debt that went septic as the housing market collapsed. The three have spent much of the last year explaining those grades and other mysteries, like why they gave the Wall Street equivalent of gold stars to the debt of a handful of companies, including Lehman Brothers before it went under and A.I.G. before its rescue.\n\nUntil a few months ago, overhauling the rating agencies looked like the proverbial low-hanging fruit of financial industry reform. But legislators have so far been unable or unwilling to truly take on the companies. Now, a number a plaintiff\u00d5s lawyers are about to try their luck in court.\n\nActually, many courts. Dozens of investors have filed lawsuits seeking redress from the rating agencies, contending that the companies bear responsibility for investors\u00d5 losses, under a Whitman\u00d5s sampler of theories. The recession, in other words, is about to begin its litigation phase, and Mr. Abrams and a handful of partners at the law firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel are readying defenses for more than 30 suits filed against S.& P. Up first, an oral argument on a motion to dismiss one case is set for July 31.\n\nWhat is this veteran of free-speech battles doing on the payroll of a company that analyzes securities?\n\nMaking an argument about the First Amendment, to begin with. Mr. Abrams will contend that S.& P.\u00d5s ratings deserve exactly the sort of free-speech protections afforded to journalists, on the theory that a bond rating is like an editorial \u00d1 an opinion based on an educated guess about the future. And for the same reason you can\u00d5t sue editorial writers, Mr. Abrams will argue that you can\u00d5t sue a bond rater because the economy went into a free fall that few saw coming.\n\n\u00d2It shouldn\u00d5t change the legal dynamics that rating agencies are more important, or play a greater role, or are looked to by this or that element of the marketplace,\u00d3 he says. \u00d2The major similarity here is that both the newspaper and S.& P. are offering opinions on matters that people can and do disagree about.\u00d3\n\nLegal scholars give this argument marks that range from \u00d2certainly plausible\u00d3 to \u00d2you\u00d5re kidding, right?\u00d3 But Mr. Abrams won\u00d5t just be talking about free speech. The First Amendment is no defense against fraud, and that is what is alleged by many of the plaintiffs. Against them, Mr. Abrams will argue that S.& P. was every bit as blindsided as nearly everyone else in the private sector and in the regulatory sphere.\n\nIt\u00d5s obviously true, he will tell judges and juries, that many of the ratings \u00d2didn\u00d5t pan out,\u00d3 as he puts it, but that doesn\u00d5t mean the company is liable for investor losses.\n\nVariations of these arguments have worked for S.& P. in the past. In fact, aside from a small settlement in an Orange County, Calif., case 10 years ago, no litigant has wrested even token sums from S.& P. Which means that today, the company stands roughly where the tobacco companies stood in the mid-1990s: unpopular in public, virtually undefeated in court.\n\nThe fortunes of Big Tobacco, you might recall, changed substantially for the worse as more people came to believe that cigarette makers had misrepresented the dangers of their products. Ultimately, four tobacco companies settled for more than $200 billion with 46 attorneys general and today are heavily regulated by the government.\n\nMr. Abrams\u00d5s goal isn\u00d5t just to prevent a similar defeat, or to beat back litigants using the weapons he\u00d5s been wielding since the late \u00d560s. He wants more than that.\n\n\u00d2Look, for the client\u00d5s interest, I very much hope that we can get rid of these litigations on motions for dismissal,\u00d3 he says. \u00d2But from a personal point of view, I look forward to the chance to defend them against those charges in court. If we have a real trial, people would say terrible things about them and I would be very happy to show that those things aren\u00d5t so.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": " SHOUTING over the hiss and screech of an assembly line, Chris Tomaras described the feat of food engineering that made him rich.\n\n\u00d2The trick,\u00d3 he yelled in a heavy Greek accent, \u00d2is to use certain forces, like temperature and pressure, to preserve the product as a solid mass, so it doesn\u00d5t deteriorate.\u00d3\n\nA dapper man with a rich baritone voice and a gray mustache, Mr. Tomaras, 73, was narrating a tour of Kronos Foods, the world\u00d5s largest manufacturer of gyros (pronounced YEE-ros, Greek for \u00d2spin\u00d3), the don\u00d5t-ask mystery meat that has been a Greek restaurant staple in the United States since the mid 1970s. Cones of gyro meat rotate on an estimated 50,000 vertical broilers across the country, to be carved a few slices at a time and folded in pita bread along with a dollop of yogurt sauce.\n\nKronos is the perfect place to pose a couple of questions that seem as if they should have been answered many hurried lunches ago: What are gyros anyway, and who made them a ubiquitous feature of Greek menus across the United States?\n\nAnd now is an appropriate time to delve into this enigma wrapped in a flatbread. A cheap meal looks pretty appealing lately, and more people than ever seem to be succumbing to this $5 temptation.\n\nWhile almost all segments of the restaurant industry are suffering, the titans of the gyro \u00d1 all of them based in Chicago \u00d1 report that sales are either steady or way up.\n\nThese companies are private, so their word will have to do. But Kronos is preparing to move to a new plant that will enable it to crank out enough cones for 600,000 sandwiches a day, about twice the capacity in its current address. A few miles away, at Devanco Foods, Peter Bartzis, the president of the company, reports record sales. \u00d2I\u00d5ve been through a few recessions,\u00d3 Mr. Bartzis said, \u00d2and they\u00d5re good times to be in the gyros business.\u00d3\n\nMr. Tomaras opened Kronos in 1975 and sold it to a private equity firm in 1994. But he returned to the plant, on a dead-end industrial road in Chicago\u00d5s southwest side, to explain how gyros are made. It\u00d5s a show and tell that is not for the squeamish.\n\nThe process starts with boxes of raw beef and lamb trimmings, and ends with what looks like oversized Popsicles the shade of a Band-Aid. In between, the meat is run through a four-ton grinder, where bread crumbs, water, oregano and other seasonings are added. A clumpy paste emerges and is squeezed into a machine that checks for metal and bone. (\u00d2You can never be too careful,\u00d3 Mr. Tomaras said.) Hydraulic pressure \u00d1 60 pounds per square inch \u00d1 is used to fuse the meat into cylinders, which are stacked on trays and then rolled into a flash freezer, where the temperature is 20 degrees below zero.\n\nGyros are believed to have originated in Greece. (They\u00d5re similar to the d\u009aner kebabs of Turkey and shawarma of the Middle East, which are slices of meat, rather than a minced loaf.) But they were never mass produced in Europe, according to the gyro magnates of this city. Until the early 1970s, the cones were made one at a time, in restaurant kitchens using family recipes.\n\nThen someone thought, why not make gyro cones the same way you make cars?\n\nThe question is: Who is the Henry Ford of the gyro? It turns out there are a handful of contenders, all of whom know one another and have been friendly competitors for decades. They include George Apostolou, who says he served the first gyros in the United States, in the Parkview Restaurant in Chicago, in 1965, and nine years later opened a 3,000-square-foot manufacturing plant, Central Gyros Wholesale.\n\n\u00d2The response to the product was tremendous,\u00d3 Mr. Apostolou said. \u00d2My two brothers and I, we became millionaires in two years\u00d5 time.\u00d3\n\nAnd what of Mr. Tomaras?\n\n\u00d2Chris claims that he brought the product here,\u00d3 Mr. Apostolou said, rather dryly. \u00d2This is a lie.\u00d3\n\nBut an engineer named Peter Parthenis says he beat Mr. Apostolou to mass production by a year, with Gyros Inc., in 1973. Mr. Parthenis started by building rotisseries, but soon realized the money was in the meat. "}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "Spurred by rising public anger, federal and state investigators are preparing for a surge of prosecutions of financial fraud.\n\nAcross the country, attorneys general have already begun indicting dozens of loan processors, mortgage brokers and bank officers. Last week alone, there were guilty pleas in Minnesota, Delaware, North Carolina and Connecticut and sentences in Florida and Vermont \u00d1 all stemming from home loan scams.\n\nWith the Obama administration focused on stabilizing the banks and restoring confidence in the stock market, it has said little about federal civil or criminal charges. But its proposed budget contains hints that it will add to this weight of litigation, including money for more F.B.I. agents to investigate mortgage fraud and white-collar crime, and a 13 percent raise for the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nOfficials at the Justice Department have not said much in public about their plans. But people who have met with Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. say he is weighing a range of strategies.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s clear that he and other top-level members of the Obama administration want to seize the opportunity to send a message of zero tolerance for mortgage fraud,\u00d3 said Connecticut\u00d5s attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, who attended a meeting with Mr. Holder and other state attorneys general last week in Washington. \u00d2The only question is when and how they will do it.\u00d3\n\nOne person who had discussed the matter with Mr. Holder, but declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak for the Justice Department, said that the attorney general was deciding whether to form a task force to centralize the effort or allow state attorneys general to develop cases on their own.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman, Matthew A. Miller, would not comment, other than to write by e-mail, \u00d2It will be a top priority of the Justice Department to hold accountable executives who have engaged in fraudulent activities.\u00d3\n\nAt the low end of the mortgage transaction ladder, state prosecutors have had a relatively easy time prevailing, but recent history suggests that the government\u00d5s odds of winning drop when they go after Wall Street executives. Some high-profile convictions have been won in the last decade, but several of the Enron-related prosecutions and some cases brought by Eliot Spitzer when he was New York\u00d5s attorney general fell apart or were overturned on appeal.\n\nAs federal authorities decide on a course of action, Congress is becoming impatient. Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, announced plans last week for a hearing on March 20, inviting Mr. Holder, bank regulators and leaders of the S.E.C. to answer questions about their enforcement plans.\n\n\u00d2Rules don\u00d5t work if people have no fear of them,\u00d3 Mr. Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said. State and local prosecutors, it seems, do not need the nudge. Last week, the district attorney\u00d5s office in Brooklyn announced the creation of a real estate fraud unit, with 12 employees and a mandate to \u00d2address the recent flood of mortgage fraud cases plaguing New Yorkers.\u00d3 In late February, Maryland unveiled a mortgage fraud task force, bringing together 17 agencies to streamline investigations.\n\nWith all the state activity and portents of a new resolve at the federal level, lawyers who defend white-collar clients sense growing momentum to perp walk and prosecute executives involved in the mortgage crisis.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s going to be open season,\u00d3 says Daniel M. Petrocelli, a lawyer whose clients include Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron. \u00d2You\u00d5ll see a lot of indictments down the road, and you\u00d5ll see a lot of prosecutions that rely on vague theories of \u00d4deprivation of honest services.\u00d5 \u00d2\n\nMany financial executives have hired lawyers in the last few months, either through internal counsels or, more discreetly, on their own, several lawyers who defend white-collar clients said.\n\nWhile assorted Wall Street executives have been prosecuted over the years, any concerted legal attack on the financial sector would have little precedent. After the Depression, Congress formed what became known as the Pecora Commission, which grilled top financiers. But the point was mostly to embarrass them, and the upshot was to set the stage for stricter regulations. The most indelible image of the commission\u00d5s hearings was a photo of J. P. Morgan Jr. with a midget who had been plopped in his lap by an opportunistic publicist.\n\nThe question behind any cases brought against Wall Street will boil down to this: Was the worst economic crisis in decades caused by law-breaking or some terrible, but noncriminal, mix of greed, na\u0095vet\u008e and blunders? The challenge for the Obama administration will be to prove that it was the former, said Michael F. Buchanan, a partner at Jenner & Block and a former United States attorney in New Jersey.\n\n\u00d2We punish people for intentional misconduct, we don\u00d5t punish them for stupidity or innocent mistakes,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2If you\u00d5re a prosecutor, you want evidence that shows real dishonesty. You want something that shows that these people were doing something wrong, and they knew it.\u00d3\n\nThat nearly all of the banking industry acted the same, possibly reckless, way could actually help any executive who lands in court, lawyers said. The herdlike behavior suggested that bankers were competing for business using widely shared assumptions, rather than trying to get away with a crime. It would be hard to prove that anyone broke the rules, these lawyers said, since regulations in the riskiest parts of the mortgage industry were so lax.\n\nOne defense lawyer said he expected to argue that either his clients did not understand the financial instruments they were marketing, or were not warned of the dangers by underlings."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "Until our economy went kerflooey, it was a whimsical reverie about the life that you could swap for the one that you were leading. It was a six-room bed-and-breakfast in Vermont that you bought and spruced up and managed into your dotage. Or a record deal, with tour support and 80 percent of the gate. Or some gadget you devised in the basement that was going to be huge.\n\nIt took many forms, the old Plan B, but it\u00d5s getting harder to conjure up any of them in detail. The idea of it is fading from our memory, obscured under the pile of bad news about layoffs and bank failures, beneath the letters with your 401(k) returns, which you learned to stop opening.\n\nInstead, we have the new Plan B, which can be summarized this way: the best you can make of a worst-case scenario, the deal you cut with a fate you might be unable to avoid. Under the new Plan B, the fortunate merely hunker down. The less fortunate slide, against their will, into a lower tax bracket and sometimes into jobs they don\u00d5t want.\n\nAs badly as our economy is tottering, the number of Americans actually living the new Plan B is still small compared to those who are not. What is slowly spreading is worry about the new Plan B. It is becoming part of our interior monologue, the anxious static in our collective heads, one of the ordeals of this downturn that doesn\u00d5t easily lend itself to measurement, like the G.D.P. or the Dow. It is not part of the economy\u00d5s visible damage, like boarded-up stores or those recession-inspired eBay listings that start with \u00d2Hate to let these go!\u00d3 or some variation on that theme.\n\nBut it\u00d5s palpable. It is part of the awkward conversation with your kids about why you can\u00d5t chip in for college, or why you might not be leaving them much of an inheritance, if you leave them an inheritance at all.\n\nThe old Plan B was a lark that you could enjoy even if you never got past the dreaming phase. The new Plan B is a menace you can fear even if you\u00d5re fully employed. It\u00d5s a threat rather than an option.\n\nIt can be foisted upon you in the way that it was foisted on Damian and Simone Lopez of Bakersfield, Calif. A UPS driver for 15 years, Mr. Lopez lost his job not long ago and today he welds aluminum tanks for a truck company. It\u00d5s solitary work, which isn\u00d5t his style, and it pays less than half the $75,000 he earned with UPS. The house he built with his wife, Simone, was foreclosed upon and will soon go up for auction.\n\n\u00d2We\u00d5re hoping that whoever buys our house will rent it back to us,\u00d3 said Mrs. Lopez, a mother of three who works at a career counseling center. \u00d2But we\u00d5re not sure we\u00d5ll be able to afford the rent.\u00d3\n\nThe Lopezes had a very different Plan B last year. It involved tuition money for a daughter in college, and a lot of golf outings in Arizona. \u00d2My husband used to collect all these golf guides,\u00d3 Mrs. Lopez said. \u00d2I\u00d5m not even sure where he got them.\u00d3\n\nWe have questions for those forced into the new Plan B because these people seem like pioneers in a mental realm where we\u00d5re all headed. Is it as gruesome there as we fear? And how quickly are you forced to give up the stuff you don\u00d5t actually need (like Showtime and dinner out) and surrender the stuff you shouldn\u00d5t live without (like health care)?\n\nAnd here\u00d5s a hopeful question: does the new Plan B have any upsides? For many, the primary goal of the old Plan B wasn\u00d5t riches. It was a means of exiting the H.O.V. lane of a career you might no longer have enjoyed. Or it was about finding \u00d2fulfillment,\u00d3 a word that is nearly impossible to say without irony at the age of 21 and accumulates meaning later on.\n\nSteve Maslow, a corporate headhunter in Manhattan, says some job candidates he has placed in the past now \u00d2see the writing on the wall\u00d3 and have started to segue into work that they actually prefer. Like the lawyer who at night runs a florist business out of his apartment, or the derivatives products controller at a Wall Street firm who has opened a furniture show room in the basement of her house in New Jersey.\n\nBut these are exceptions.\n\n\u00d2Just about everyone I work with is trying to figure out Plan B,\u00d3 Mr. Maslow says, \u00d2but most people think of it as a stop-gap measure, a way to stop the bleeding, a place to go every day. It used to have the flavor of once-upon-a-time, the thing I\u00d5ll do when I\u00d5m 55 and have a nest egg. That\u00d5s pretty much over.\u00d3\n\nIt died, it seems, along with the nest egg. Part of the old Plan B was an imagined sit-down with a professional accountant who would run the numbers and tell you, yes, this will work, as long as you spend \u00d2X dollars\u00d3 per year, and nothing more. Without the nest egg, there are no numbers to run. There are only extravagances to jettison.\n\n\u00d2I got rid of everything luxurious,\u00d3 says Bob Hunter, 52, a real estate investor in Miami, whose $8 million in holdings have plunged in value since the downturn. \u00d2I drive a Ford pickup truck. I used to drive a BMW 5 Series, and I was going to upgrade from there, to the 6 Series convertible.\u00d3\n\nThe old Plan B for Mr. Hunter was a two-day workweek, with the management of his properties handled by nephews, and lots of trips back to Pittsburgh to see family. Plus fishing. Now, he works seven days a week. The downturn has outlasted his savings, so the only money coming in is from rentals and the occasional sale of property, for below what he paid.\n\n\u00d2I buy shoes if the old ones are worn out,\u00d3 he says. \u00d2We don\u00d5t go shopping and we don\u00d5t go on vacation.\u00d3\n\nUnlike the old Plan B, the new one doesn\u00d5t involve a lot of plane tickets. Unless you are one of the recently laid off employees of IBM, who, under a program called Project Match, can remain on the Big Blue payroll if they move to a developing country where the company has openings, like India, China or Brazil.\n\nWorrying about the new Plan B is part of life across such a wide range of industries that it\u00d5s getting harder for anyone contemplating a leap to figure out where to land. Poonam Mahtani, who works in a Manhattan fashion house that she\u00d5d rather not identify \u00d1 \u00d2Just put that I\u00d5m really happy to have a job\u00d3\u00d1 says that layoffs in her field are so rampant that everyone she knows is working on Plan B.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5ve been thinking about business school,\u00d3 she says. \u00d2Or bartending, maybe yoga instructor. I don\u00d5t know. What is safe out there?\u00d3\n\nThe new Plan B relies heavily on improvisation. Rob Hall left his job with Wachovia Securities last year when he passed on his company\u00d5s offer to relocate him from Richmond, Va., to St. Louis, as part of a restructuring. He looked at a bunch of franchising opportunities and wound up owning a mobile pet-grooming business.\n\n\u00d2If you\u00d5d told me two years ago that I\u00d5d own an Aussie Pet Mobile, I\u00d5d have thought you were insane,\u00d3 Mr. Hall says. He also started a consulting firm with a few former Wachovia friends, not all of whom were pleased that he\u00d5d taken on two very different projects. \u00d2Maybe it seemed like I was hedging my bets,\u00d3 he says.\n\nWhich he was.

{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "DEARLY beloved.\n\nWe are gathered here today, in the midst of economic calamity, to ask if we really should be gathered here today, in a funhouse of merchandise designed to send us deeper into debt.\n\nSpecifically, we are gathered in the Chapel of Love, sandwiched between a LensCrafters and a Bloomingdale\u00d5s and tucked into a relatively quiet corner of the vast prairie of retail and amusements that is the Mall of America.\n\nIt\u00d5s a convenient starting point for rethinking the 50-year marriage between the American shopper and the American mall. Because we\u00d5ve been married to the mall for so long that some of us are now getting married in the mall \u00d1 5,000 couples in this chapel since it opened 10 years ago.\n\nAnd one recent Sunday afternoon, Brianna and Jesse Bergmann are standing here under a white wedding arch, beside an ordained minister, having promised to cherish each other in sickness and in health. There was a homily about forgiveness, an exchange of vows and finally a kiss and some applause.\n\nBefore everyone heads past the Foot Locker and down the escalator to the Rainforest Cafe, the bride \u00d1 a cherubic 19-year-old \u00d1 leans against a wall in her billowy white dress and explains why she chose this spot for her big day.\n\n\u00d2I love shopping,\u00d3 she says, giggling. \u00d2Mostly clothing. I love Macy\u00d5s, Aero\u00d5s, American Eagle, Maurice\u00d5s.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2I come with her when she shops,\u00d3 says her husband, a 21-year-old who loads pallets in a food warehouse, \u00d2so she doesn\u00d5t spend too much.\u00d3\n\nHere, ladies and gentlemen, is the crux of the problem: We are reliably informed that whatever part of the economic crisis can\u00d5t be pinned on Wall Street \u00d1 or on mortgage-related financial insanity \u00d1 can be pinned on consumers who overspent. But personal consumption amounts to some 70 percent of the American economy. So if we don\u00d5t spend, we don\u00d5t recover. Fiscal health isn\u00d5t possible until money is again sloshing into cash registers, including those at this mall and every other retailer.\n\nIn other words, shopping was part of the problem and now it\u00d5s part of the cure. And once we\u00d5re cured, economists report, we really need to learn how to save, which suggests that we will need to quit shopping again.\n\nSo the mall we married has become the toxic spouse we can\u00d5t quit, though we really must quit, but just not any time soon. The mall, for its part, is wounded by our ambivalence and feels financially adrift.\n\nLike any other troubled marriage, this one needs counseling. And pronto, because even a trial separation at a moment as precarious as this could get really ugly.\n\nSo we have come to this 4.2-million-square-foot behemoth \u00d1 the mother of all malls, a pioneer in the field of destination retailing, and a sprawling, visceral economic indicator \u00d1 for some talk therapy with shoppers, retailers and management. We let people vent, grumble and sift through their feelings. They catalog their anxieties, describe their fears and express the surprising varieties of guilt that only dysfunctional relationships can produce.\n\n\u00d2I feel a need to get out there and do the mall thing, because I don\u00d5t want the mall to disappear,\u00d3 says Cookie Tomlinson, who is visiting from Maryland and sits on a bench next to her son near Lego Park.\n\nMrs. Tomlinson and her husband are here Christmas shopping for their two grandchildren, who are too young to realize that their gifts are a tad late. \u00d2It\u00d5s a social experience, being with the grandkids, watching them interact,\u00d3 she says.\n\nHer son, Gary Tomlinson, is a computer repairman who wears a black T-shirt that reads, \u00d2No, I will not fix your computer.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2The mall is tactile in a way that online shopping isn\u00d5t,\u00d3 he says. \u00d2So the kids pick out stuff that they wouldn\u00d5t pick out if we were at home shopping on the Web.\u00d3\n\nBut could you quit the mall if you had to?\n\n\u00d2Yeah, I could quit the mall,\u00d3 he says. \u00d2But I don\u00d5t want to see it die.\u00d3\n\nTHERE are roughly 1,500 malls in the United States, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, many of them ailing, some of them being converted into office buildings, and others closing their doors for good.

But one thing she won\u00d5t miss about JPMorgan: telling people that she works there.\n\nEmanuel Pleitez previously worked for Goldman Sachs and is now running for Congress in Los Angeles.\n \n\u00d2For a long time, it was kind of glamorous and I had friends who\u00d5d ask me \u00d4Can you get me a job there?\u00d5 \u00d3 says Ms. Chau, 35, who was part of a recent round of layoffs at the firm\u00d5s Manhattan headquarters. A few weeks ago, she mentioned her work to a photographer she\u00d5d met through a friend. \u00d2And he looks at me and says, \u00d4Oh, you\u00d5re one of them.\u00d5 \u00d3\n\nNobody in the investment banking world is expecting pity, or even a sympathetic ear, these days. But while the rest of the country fumes over the billions spent on government bailouts and year-end bonuses, the financial industry is focused on its new role as national pariah and its own lengthy list of anxieties.\n\nThere are the endless rounds of corporate implosions to sweat. There is the widespread sense of being unfairly singled out for vilification in a crisis that a host of players helped create \u00d1 among them homeowners, who were only too happy to feast on the bounty that Wall Street helped cater in the flush years.\n\nOn top of all that, there is a lot of wincing about the profession\u00d5s catastrophic loss of cultural cachet. Wall Street has become a target of populist rage, raw material for talk-show tirades, the occasional street protest and a lot of punch lines.\n\nA recent political cartoon in The Record, a newspaper in Hackensack, N.J., shows rats fleeing a sinking ship, labeled \u00d2Wall Street,\u00d3 with treasure chests held aloft tagged \u00d2CEO\u00d3 and \u00d2Bonus.\u00d3 There are \u00d2I Hate Investment Banking\u00d3 T-shirts for sale online. Last week on \u00d2The Daily Show,\u00d3 Jon Stewart rolled a clip of John A. Thain, Merrill Lynch\u00d5s chief executive, defending bonuses as a way to keep \u00d2your best people.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2You don\u00d5t have \u00d4best people\u00d5!\u00d3 Mr. Stewart shouted. \u00d2You lost $27 billion! Do you live in Bizarro World?\u00d3\n\nAll of this has taken a toll on the few industry veterans willing to discuss the subject.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5d almost rather say I\u00d5m a pornographer,\u00d3 said a retired Wall Street executive who, for self-evident reasons, asked not to be identified. \u00d2At least that\u00d5s a business that people understand.\u00d3\n\nFinanciers tell their not-for-attribution account of the mortgage crisis like this: Americans undersaved and overspent for decades, relying on rising property values to bankroll their lifestyles. But nobody on Wall Street forced United States homeowners to take out loans on houses they couldn\u00d5t afford, or refinance mortgages to spend money on cars they shouldn\u00d5t have bought.\n\nThe esoteric securities underneath the current mess are, to the people who invented and marketed them, analogous to pharmaceutical drugs. Used correctly, they can enhance your life. Abused, they are lethal.\n\nOf course, mistakes were made on Wall Street, says Emanuel Pleitez, a 26-year-old former Goldman Sachs employee who resigned from his job a few months ago to run for Congress in his hometown, Los Angeles. But to a great extent, he says, those mistakes were born of misplaced trust.\n\n\u00d2Look, you can talk about collateralized debt obligations all day long,\u00d3 he said, referring to a type of asset-backed security that has turned famously toxic. \u00d2But there were ratings agencies that were supposed to tell us how risky these securities were. We essentially closed our eyes and said, \u00d4O.K., you say this is rated triple-A, fine, I believe you.\u00d5 \u00d3 In hindsight, he said, \u00d2Everyone should have been more skeptical.\u00d3\n\nYou hear a lot about the failure of regulators, too. But it\u00d5s difficult to find anyone in the financial trenches who thinks the problem is Wall Street itself. Difficult, but not impossible.\n\n\u00d2People say \u00d4Well, the Fed is to blame because there was all this loose money,\u00d5 \u00d3 said Luis E. Rinaldini, a former partner at the investment banking firm Lazard Fr\u008fres, now at the merchant bank Groton Partners. \u00d2But guys who run banks are paid to be cautious when there\u00d5s loose money around.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2I mean, if you had a bus driver who went 100 miles an hour on an icy road, you\u00d5d think he was crazy,\u00d3 he adds. \u00d2But if his boss said, \u00d4It\u00d5s our policy to drive faster as the roads get icier,\u00d5 you wouldn\u00d5t be surprised if the boss ended up in jail.\u00d3\n\nBy historical standards, this is not Wall Street\u00d5s worst bout of infamy, though it might come pretty close. Last week, President Obama branded Wall Street bankers \u00d2shameful\u00d3 for giving themselves nearly $20 billion in bonuses, even though the average bonus, $112,000, was down by 36.7 percent from the prior year.\n\nThat criticism isn\u00d5t quite the buggy whippings that Franklin Delano Roosevelt routinely gave \u00d2unscrupulous money changers.\u00d3 And the recent rallies in front of the New York Stock Exchange \u00d1 with chants of \u00d2You bought it, you broke it\u00d3 \u00d1 are downright peaceful compared to the 1920 bombing of J.P. Morgan\u00d5s offices, which killed more than 30 people."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "For bowlers the ultimate test is the 7-10 split. For card sharks it\u00d5s the hot shot cut. For drummers it\u00d5s the funky little miracle of syncopation known as the Purdie Shuffle.\n\nBernard Purdie, creator of the Purdie Shuffle, at the Hirschfeld Theater.\nGems Agency/Redferns, via Getty Images\n\nBernard Purdie about 1970, when he was providing the beat for top stars. Mr. Purdie is now playing drums in \u00d2Hair\u00d3 on Broadway.\n\nYou\u00d5ve heard Bernard Purdie \u00d1 better known as Pretty Purdie \u00d1 perform his creation on Steely Dan\u00d5s \u00d2Home at Last,\u00d3 from the 1977 album \u00d2Aja.\u00d3 And you\u00d5ve heard variations on songs by Led Zeppelin (\u00d2Fool in the Rain\u00d3), Toto (\u00d2Rosanna\u00d3) and Death Cab for Cutie (\u00d2Grapevine Fires\u00d3).\n\nCreated with six bass, high-hat and snare tones, the Purdie Shuffle is a groove that seems to spin in concentric circles as it lopes forward. The result is a Tilt-a-Whirl of sound, and if you can listen without shaking your hips, you should probably see a doctor.\n\nNow the beat has a whole new life. On YouTube dozens of amateurs, aspiring pros and assorted dilettantes have uploaded videos of their attempts to teach or demonstrate the Purdie Shuffle.\n\nBut you post at your peril. A guy identified as BazyBeats was savaged in the comments section of the video he posted of his attempt at \u00d2Fool in the Rain.\u00d3 He slightly bungled the pattern on the snare, and dozens of angry nitpickers let him know it. Eventually he asked them to \u00d2go somewhere else with your negative, hateful, blackhearted and useless souls.\u00d3\n\nMr. Purdie can be found these days at the Al Hirschfeld Theater playing for the Broadway revival of \u00d2Hair,\u00d3 which has been in previews since early March and opens Tuesday.\n\nFor Mr. Purdie, the \u00d2Hair\u00d3 gig is one of those full-circle experiences that can\u00d5t be planned. He worked with the show\u00d5s composer, Galt MacDermot, in New York in the early 1960s, when demos of the songs for the show were first recorded. Those tracks were later refined for the musical.\n\nAt the time Mr. Purdie was a relative newcomer to the city, having spent most of his life in Elkton, Md., a town near the Delaware border. One of 15 children, he had started by banging on his mother\u00d5s pots and pans.\n\n\u00d2I knew right away that\u00d5s what I wanted to do with the rest of my life,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2No matter what happened, I wanted to play the drums.\u00d3\n\nMr. Purdie, who says he is 68, was sitting at a sushi bar across the street from the theater, dressed in a dark suit and a satiny white tie. He was an hour from changing into Tommy Bahama-style casual wear and climbing onto the rear of a colorful pickup truck stationed onstage, where he drums for the show.\n\nHe\u00d5s an ample, teddy-bearish guy with a graying mustache, a hearty laugh and an ego that is legendarily large. For years he showed up at sessions with two professionally made signs, which he would place on music stands near his kit. \u00d2You done hired the hit maker,\u00d3 read one. \u00d2If you need me, call me, the little old hit maker,\u00d3 said the other. It was both a gimmick and a calling card, and it would have come across as pure braggadocio except that Mr. Purdie always delivered.\n\n\u00d2He was one of the top five drummers in Manhattan back when Atlantic was recording here, when all these great independent labels were recording here,\u00d3 said Phil Ramone, a producer who worked with Mr. Purdie in the late \u00d560s and went on to record Paul Simon and Billy Joel. \u00d2Purdie just had a way of inspiring confidence in everyone.\u00d3\n\nHe also had a way of implying that he was finished with a session as soon as he had nailed his part, which was often before anyone else in the room.\n\n\u00d2You\u00d5d do a first take, and he\u00d5d put on his overcoat as if he was about to leave,\u00d3 said Donald Fagen, the Steely Dan keyboardist. \u00d2The problem was that some of the other musicians had just become comfortable with the chords. You had to cajole him to do some other takes so everyone else could polish up their parts a bit.\u00d3\n\nWithin a few years of arriving in Manhattan Mr. Purdie was touring and recording with the greats of \u00d560s soul, funk and jazz, including James Brown, Aretha Franklin and Louis Armstrong. He is heard on more than 4,000 records.\n\nSome of the greats, in his telling, were ornery characters. The Godfather of Soul fined him $25 for a mistake he didn\u00d5t make, prompting Mr. Purdie to quit. During a concert with Ray Charles in Chicago, when Mr. Purdie started playing a few bars too soon, Charles barked, \u00d2Don\u00d5t play, drummer,\u00d3 into the microphone, a rather public embarrassment before a huge crowd.\n\n\u00d2He would turn around and look at you \u00d1 I always thought the guy could see,\u00d3 Mr. Purdie said. \u00d2And he\u00d5d say, \u00d4What is your problem?\u00d5 Now, what are you supposed to say to that?\u00d3\n\nBefore the current \u00d2Hair\u00d3 gig Mr. Purdie spent much of his time in different bands, one of which, the Hudson River Rats, plays a lot of private parties and clubs. He is sampled often, turning up on Beck\u00d5s \u00d2Devil\u00d5s Haircut\u00d3 and most recently in \u00d2Mother of All Funk Chords,\u00d3 a YouTube mash-up by an Israeli producer known as Kutiman."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "On Thursday night, a crowd gathered in Union Square in Manhattan for a fond and spontaneous memorial to Michael Jackson. A few hundred onlookers formed a circle, leaving enough space in the middle for the grandstanders and the brave to dance like the King of Pop. Or try to.\n\nTHE KING In a fractured culture, Michael Jackson has no viable heirs.\n\nEven the lamest moonwalk drew chants of \u00d2Mi-chael, Mi-chael!\u00d3\n\nWatching this spectacle, you had to wonder: When will this happen again? When will another pop culture figure mean so much to so many that people are moved to assemble, hug and dance?\n\nThis is a tribute, of course, to Mr. Jackson\u00d5s singular gifts \u00d1 his voice, songwriting talent, physical grace, and the list goes on and on. But there is the related matter of historical timing. Fame on the level that Mr. Jackson achieved is all but impossible for pop culture heroes today, and quite likely it will never be possible again.\n\nOn the most basic level, this is matter of business and math. Michael Jackson has sold an estimated 100 million copies worldwide of the 1982 album \u00d2Thriller,\u00d3 which spent more than 31 weeks at the top of the Billboard charts.\n\nIt\u00d5s one of those high-water marks that nobody will touch, because record stores are vanishing, and along with them, megahit albums are vanishing, too. A big week on the Billboard charts is a quarter-million units sold, which is about the number of units the Jonas Brothers moved last week with their latest release, which opened at No. 1. And it\u00d5s rare for an album to last even three weeks at the top.\n\nPeople who buy music tend these days to buy \u00d1 or steal it \u00d1 online, a song at time.\n\nBut even if nobody achieves album sales on a Jacksonian scale, couldn\u00d5t he or she be an artist every bit as popular, every bit as loved, every bit as listened to?\n\nProbably not. The pop-idol field \u00d1 like every field that can lead to super-fame \u00d1 is more crowded than it has ever been, and the variety of routes to stardom keep growing. When the Beatles were on \u00d2The Ed Sullivan Show\u00d3 in 1964, more than 70 million people watched, that is, more than one-third of the entire population of the United States. Yes, the Beatles were that good. But at the time, there were three networks and the radio. No Facebook, Twitter, video games, movie multiplexes, Sirius radio, malls or a dozen other potential drains on an audience.\n\nThere weren\u00d5t a lot of rock bands, either. George Harrison was the only Beatle who\u00d5d visited the United States before the group landed for that historic performance \u00d1 his sister lived in Illinois \u00d1 and when he returned to England he gleefully informed his mates that nobody in America could compete.\n\nLikewise, Michael Jackson had MTV, which was the place for music videos, and as close to an Ed Sullivan platform as he needed. Of course, it\u00d5s been a long time since MTV played hour after hour of prime-time videos. Today, you watch music videos on YouTube, but because there are no programmers to curate what you see, every artist has to compete with thousands of others. And now that anyone with a computer has a miniature studio, and anyone with a Internet connection can post a song, there are more genres, subgenres and artists than ever.\n\nThat\u00d5s why even Michael Jackson would have a hard time becoming Michael Jackson these days. Come to think of it, Farrah Fawcett, who also passed away this week, would never have become Farrah Fawcett if she showed up in that red, one-piece bathing suit today. In the \u00d570s, she became the fantasy of choice for every post-pubescent teenage boy in the country, selling 10 million posters of her iconic, high-beam smile. Now, there are so many vixens grinning seductively from so many Web sites and lad mags that no single woman could ever commandeer the public imagination in quite the same way. There is no \u00d2this year\u00d5s model\u00d3 anymore. There is this week\u00d5s model, and that\u00d5s about it.\n\nThere are plenty of upsides to the new unfiltered, multiple-choice pop culture of 2009. We get to decide what we want to listen to and watch, and we can listen and watch whenever we want. It\u00d5s far better for aficionados, too, because they can dig deeper into any topic, no matter how obscure. Obsessed with a soccer team in Germany? Twenty years ago, you\u00d5d be lucky to spot it twice a year on TV. Now, you can watch it online, and a dozen blogs are there to parse every goal, red card and trade.\n\nBut there is something sad about our infinite menu of options. It could very well mean the end of true superstardom and with it, the end the collective experience on display Thursday night in Union Square.\n\nEveryone there knew Michael Jackson. Everyone there had watched him, sang with him, tried to dance with him and, yes, everyone was collectively aghast by much of his recent behavior. But he was ours. If nothing else, his passing reminds us of how little in pop culture we currently share.\n\nAnd inadvertently, that Union Square memorial demonstrated why. In the middle of the impromptu festivities, a pedicab cycled by with a platform attached to the back. Jutting from the platform: a silver, 10-foot stripper pole, on which a woman in lingerie was spinning, legs splayed, upside down, then right side up, then upside down again.\n\nThere were flashing lights and, inevitably, the name of a Web site stenciled on the side.\n\nHalf of the people in the Michael Jackson throng spotted the rolling spectacle and started pointing. A few dozen turned on their heels and joined this woman and her cycler in a slow, jaw-dropping and highly distracting procession down the street."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "The renowned investor Warren Buffett was uncharacteristically critical of himself and the business world at large in his annual letter to the shareholders of his holding company on Saturday, as he sifted through the wreckage of his worst year in four decades.\n\nBuffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, reported a 62 percent drop in net income for 2008 and posted negative results for only the second time since he took control in 1965.\n\nBuffett took the blame for some of that grim performance, stating that he \"did some dumb things,\" but he also registered anger at the decisions and practices in the rest of the business world that he predicted would leave the stock market a shambles through 2009.\n\nThe letter, as ever, gives shareholders an overview of Berkshire's annual performance, but it also doubles as a folksy state-of-the-economy address from one of the country's most revered investors.\n\nIn language that was by turns blunt and witty, he lamented what he called \"a series of life-threatening problems within many of the world's great financial institutions.\" His heaviest scolding was reserved for the heads of private equity firms and mortgage issuers.\n\nBuffett, an inveterate optimist about the American economy, also found reasons for cheer.\n\n\"As we view Geico's current opportunities,\" he wrote, referring to the insurance company that Berkshire Hathaway owns, he and his company's chief executive \"feel like two hungry mosquitoes in a nudist camp. Juicy targets are everywhere.\"\n\nReviewing the performance of Clayton Homes, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary that sells manufactured homes, he noted that its lending arm had managed to keep foreclosure rates to less than 4 percent, even among subprime borrowers, or those with weak credit ratings.\n\nHe contrasted that relative success with the failures of just about everyone else in that business.\n\n\"The stupefying losses in mortgage-related securities came in large part because of flawed, history-based models used by salesmen, rating agencies and investors,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went on: \"These parties looked at loss experience over periods when home prices rose only moderately and speculation in houses was negligible. They then made this experience a yardstick for evaluating future losses. They blissfully ignored the fact that house prices had recently skyrocketed, loan practices had deteriorated and many buyers had opted for houses they couldn't afford.\"\n\nAlso blissfully ignored, he wrote, were the perils of relying on mathematical models devised without worst-case situations in mind. Too often, he wrote, Americans have been enamored of \"a nerdy-sounding priesthood, using esoteric terms such as beta, gamma, sigma and the like.\" Some skepticism about these models is overdue, he added.\n\n\"Our advice: Beware of geeks bearing formulas.\"\n\nBuffett was just as scathing on the subject of derivatives, which he famously likened to weapons of mass destruction long before they started eviscerating the balance sheets of banks around the world.\n\nIn his letter, Buffett explained that the danger of derivatives was not merely the difficulty in assessing their value; rather, it was the \"web of mutual dependence\" they create among financial institutions. Derivatives contracts keep various parties entangled for years.\n\nOnce those assets start deteriorating, he wrote, \"Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease: It's not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.\"\n\nBuffett also delved into the derivatives owned by Berkshire. He explained that they were structured in ways that required counterparties to make payments to Berkshire when the contracts were initiated, providing his company with an advance of $8.1 billion, referred to as a float.\n\n\"This float is similar to insurance float,\" he wrote. \"If we break even on an underlying transaction, we will have enjoyed the use of free money for a long time.\"\n\nNonetheless, Berkshire recorded a loss of $5.1 billion, after adjusting the value of its derivatives holdings.\n\nStill, Buffett's report was greeted with sighs of relief among some shareholders. \"I'm delighted,\" said Janet Tavokoli, a derivatives expert and author of \"Dear Mr. Buffett,\" about the credit crisis of 2008. \"Of course it was a tough year \u00d1 the toughest year of his life. But I was concerned about the impact in operating earnings and I was prepared for much worse.\"\n\nBuffett was unsparing about his own mistakes. For example, he bought a block of ConocoPhillips shares just as oil and gas prices were reaching their highest levels. The move was timed so poorly, he wrote, that even with a rebound in prices, the cost to Berkshire will probably be several billion dollars.\n\nHe also bought shares of two Irish banks for $244 million, which subsequently have decreased more than 89 percent. \"The tennis crowd,\" he wrote, \"would call my mistakes 'unforced errors.' \""}

They hung the midnight-black missing-in-action banner at his home in Queens, offsetting its grimness with the bright hues of the Dominican and American flags.

He was one of three members of the same Army unit \u00d1 Company D, Fourth Battalion, 31st Infantry, Second Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, based at Fort Drum in upstate New York \u00d1 captured in the attack. Four Americans in the same unit and one Iraqi interpreter were killed.\n\nSince that day \u00d1 May 12, 2007 \u00d1 his family and friends kept hoping that he would someday walk down the street again and fill the house with his usual jokes and laughter. Soon after the attack, the soldiers had come to their door to tell them that he had been captured. Last month, they were notified that his remains had been found near an Iraqi village and identified.\n\nThe procession began Thursday at Hinton Park, near Shea Stadium. About 70 family members and friends had gathered there, dressed in black T-shirts bearing his image. When the motorcade carrying his remains appeared at 1 p.m., shrieks of sorrow erupted. His closest family members, including his mother, father and widow, stayed inside the cars.\n\nOn the street, his aunts crowded around the car, pressing their hands against the windows as it slowed. \u00d2My beautiful child,\u00d3 one of them cried repeatedly in Spanish. \u00d2No, no, no!\u00d3\n\nThe mourners marched alongside the hearse the few blocks to the Rivera Funeral Home, stopping at the family home on 37th Drive along the way. (Last week, a funeral Mass was said in Lawrence, Mass., where Sergeant Jimenez\u00d5s father lives. After a public viewing, he will be buried on Long Island on Saturday.)\n\nThe funeral home is across the street from Our Lady of Sorrows Church, where Sergeant Jimenez was baptized. A color guard took his flag-draped coffin inside.\n\nOutside the church, Specialist Shaun Gopaul, 29, spoke of the man he had considered a brother since the day they met five years ago. Specialist Gopaul was about a third of a mile away when the ambush occurred. He said he tries not to think about it.\n\nInstead, he remembers the days that his best friend would teach him how to dance to bachata and reggaet\u0097n music, and the time they spent writing music together.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5ll never forget him,\u00d3 Specialist Gopaul said. \u00d2He\u00d5s in my heart.\u00d3\n\nA cousin of Sergeant Jimenez, Johan Duran, 31, remembered the time they spent playing in the backyard of the house on 37th Drive after the family moved to New York from the Dominican Republic. He remembered his cousin\u00d5s bursting-at-the-seams sense of humor.\n\n\u00d2Out of any bad situations, he would always make you laugh,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2He was always cracking jokes.\u00d3\n\nWhen Mr. Duran got the call with news of his cousin\u00d5s death, he said he felt as if he had been punched in the stomach.\n\n\u00d2You know the odds are against you, but you want to believe,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2We\u00d5re happy we have some kind of closure.\u00d3\n\nSergeant Jimenez\u00d5s wife of four years, Yaderlin, dressed in black, recalled the year and two months in suspense. \u00d2We lost everything,\u00d3 she said in Spanish. \u00d2But we had faith in God.\u00d3\n\nShe remembered her husband\u00d5s infectious happiness and said he died fighting for what he believed in.\n\n\u00d2If he were here,\u00d3 she said, \u00d2he would also have felt the same way we feel \u00d1 proud to see how the whole world, the whole town, everyone in the United States has supported him and remember him as the hero that he was.\u00d3\n\nAs mourners filed out of the funeral home, their eyes fixed on a gold-framed, black-and-white portrait of Sergeant Jimenez outside. They walked down 104th Street, making their way back to the yellow house on 37th Drive.\n\nThey gathered by the gate, the flags flapping above them in the breeze, and cried once more."}

A mother, father and widow, haunted by that day last August, forced their eyes upon the building they had tried to eliminate from their memories.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5m numb. I\u00d5m not thinking,\u00d3 said Rosemarie Graffagnino, the mother of Joseph Graffagnino, a 33-year-old firefighter who died battling a fire at the building, the Deutsche Bank tower, last year. \u00d2That\u00d5s the way you survive sometimes.\u00d3\n\nIt has been 309 days since the fire tore through the empty tower near ground zero, killing Firefighter Graffagnino and a colleague, Robert Beddia, 53.\n\n\u00d2They should blow that building up so nobody has to look at it anymore,\u00d3 said Firefighter Graffagnino\u00d5s widow, Linda, who, like his parents, had avoided the site since the fire.\n\nOn Saturday, more than 100 friends and family members of both fallen firefighters and elected officials marched from the boarded-up high rise, which was badly damaged on 9/11 and was in the process of being dismantled when the fire broke out, to City Hall. They called for fire safety improvements and more stringent safety codes at buildings and construction sites. They wore navy blue shirts emblazoned with the men\u00d5s nicknames and vowed to fight for safer working conditions.\n\nOver the past year, the Graffagnino family has oscillated between sorrow and rage. They miss Firefighter Graffagnino\u00d5s gleaming smile and brawny hugs, and are eager to get answers from a pending investigation into the fire by the Manhattan district attorney\u00d5s office.\n\n\u00d2The people who are to blame are going to pay,\u00d3 Rosemarie Graffagnino said. \u00d2They think they can get away with murder, but they can\u00d5t.\u00d3\n\nConfidence in the city\u00d5s construction industry has suffered after several fatal accidents, including two crane collapses in Manhattan, this year. As a result, the city has moved to hire more inspectors and has increased the number of safety examinations at construction sites.\n\nAn investigation after the Deutsche Bank blaze uncovered several fire hazards, including the absence of a piece of standpipe intended to carry water to higher floors. Federal safety regulators have accused the contractors who were taking down the building of ignoring safety risks.\n\nThe rally on Saturday was meant to put pressure on government officials to ensure that proper safety measures are put in place and enforced to prevent disasters. \u00d2We want to save other families from going through what we went through,\u00d3 Rosemarie Graffagnino said. \u00d2We don\u00d5t want anyone else to die.\u00d3\n\nThe rally also coincided with the first anniversary of the death of another firefighter, Daniel F. Pujdak, who fell four stories to his death while fighting a Brooklyn fire.\n\nSome demonstrators held signs calling for the dismissal of city officials, and others criticized what they saw as a tendency by construction companies and the city to cut corners rather than commit to an investment in equipment and enforcement.\n\nFirefighter Graffagnino\u00d5s father, also named Joseph, is advocating the use of technology, including radio-frequency identification instead of roll calls, to help pinpoint the location of each firefighter at a fire.\n\n\u00d2The city needs to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century,\u00d3 he said.\n\nLinda Graffagnino lives in Brooklyn, a block and a half from her in-laws. After he was killed, she had a tattoo etched on her left arm bearing her husband\u00d5s Fire Department badge number, 375.\n\n\u00d2He was my best friend. He was the best father,\u00d3 she said.\n\nThe family sees his face in his two children, 4-year-old Mia and 19-month-old Joseph, and they try to devote their time to watching the children grow. They miss the days when Firefighter Graffagnino would come home from work and play hide-and-seek with his daughter, usually hiding behind the couch.\n\nAt night, they barely sleep.\n\n\u00d2You go home and sit in the dark and think and it all comes back,\u00d3 said Firefighter Graffagnino\u00d5s father. \u00d2Everything changes \u00d1 your whole focus, your purpose.

Instead, the street was filled with pedestrians and bicycles.\n\nTim Lee, left, and Lem Chen from Fu Kee Chinese restaurant had to carry a roast pig three blocks to a delivery truck.\n\n\nJason Phelps, 34, stepped off the curb, tilted his sunglasses and froze. \u00d2I\u00d5ve just walked into a swarm of bicyclists,\u00d3 he told someone on his cellphone. \u00d2I don\u00d5t know what they want,\u00d3 he joked, \u00d2but I\u00d5m going to close my eyes and pray.\u00d3\n\nThe ding of bicycle bells and the chatter of people on foot replaced the usual automobile noises along 6.9 miles of Manhattan for six hours on Saturday. It was the first day of Summer Streets, the city\u00d5s experiment in car-free recreation modeled on similar efforts in Guadalajara, Mexico; Bogot\u0087, Colombia; Paris; and several American cities.\n\nOn a path that extended from the Brooklyn Bridge north to Park Avenue and the Upper East Side, thousands of people filled the streets, taking part in activities like street-side tai chi or salsa dancing. Others simply enjoyed the chance to stroll in normally car-clogged streets. In a city where walkers, cyclists and motorists must share limited space, having a major thoroughfare through Manhattan free of cars created a giddy sort of excitement.\n\nDeborah Fried, 48, a tourist from California, rented a bicycle outside the Loews Regency Hotel on Park Avenue. Ms. Fried said she regularly rode her bicycle at the beach near her hometown of Pacific Palisades, but she had never bicycled on her visits to Manhattan .\n\nShe said the Summer Streets path felt safe.\n\n\u00d2You don\u00d5t have to worry and be killed by a taxi,\u00d3 she said. \u00d2To me, this beats bicycling on the beach because you get the flavor of the city.\u00d3\n\nThe route was broken up by three rest stops, where water, maps and first aid were available. The stops also featured music and dance performances, and yoga and other exercise classes. Police officers directed traffic at 24 streets crossing the route.\n\nRabbi Jonathan Feldman, 47, took advantage of the break in traffic for a walk with his children before morning services. He said he appreciated the early morning quiet on Park Avenue.\n\n\u00d2It gives the city a certain calmness that it doesn\u00d5t have otherwise,\u00d3 Rabbi Feldman said.\n\nThe city may make Summer Streets, which continues the next two Saturdays from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., a regular event if it proves to be a success (city officials have said that this would be a subjective measure).\n\nAlthough Department of Transportation officials said they did not yet have an estimate of how many people turned out on Saturday, Janette Sadik-Khan, the transportation commissioner, praised the debut. \u00d2Summer Streets really struck a chord this morning,\u00d3 she said in a statement.\n\nThe plan to close off streets had drawn criticism from shop owners, who feared it would hurt business. But the city assured skeptics that Summer Streets might bring more customers to their stores.\n\nOn Saturday, the economic impact remained unclear. Martha Barzola, 37, manager of a Papyrus stationery store on Park Avenue, said that the area around the store during summer weekends can sometimes resemble a ghost town. Because of the increased foot traffic, however, her store achieved its sales goal of $600 for the day within two hours, she said.\n\nBut Ibrahim Hamzah, an assistant manager for an Edison ParkFast lot on the corner of Lafayette and Great Jones Streets, said he had not had a single customer, in contrast to the 30 or 40 cars that is typical for a Saturday in summer.\n\n\u00d2The number of times this is going to happen should be minimal,\u00d3 Mr. Hamzah said. \u00d2We\u00d5re losing money, and it makes the job boring.\u00d3\n\nThere were other complaints. One woman, who declined to give her name because she was in a rush, said she had to park several blocks away to get to a medical appointment. Other pedestrians said that some novice riders, still learning to control their bicycles, were a danger to those on foot. Delivery of food to restaurants was disrupted because trucks could not get in.\n\nTaxi drivers had also worried that Summer Streets would reduce the number of people hailing cabs. But Ali Sada, parking his cab for a few minutes at Park Avenue and 57th Street, praised the event.\n\n\u00d2All these people are going to be tired when they put their bikes away,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2We\u00d5re going to make a lot more money.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "javier_c_hernandez", "text": "Congress is again looking to give companies more time to replenish employee pension plans, worried that looming payments will crimp their cash flow and slow hiring.\n\nBut by allowing pensions to remain inadequately funded, lawmakers would also increase the risk that the government would have to pick up the tab for pension payments owed by bankrupt companies. A bill introduced on Tuesday in the House would give struggling employers the option of spreading out required contributions to retirement plans over nine years, rather than the seven years they are now allowed. Under the proposal, companies would make only token payments for the first two years.\n\nTo discourage companies from joining the many businesses that have frozen pension benefits for workers, Congress would also give employers up to 15 years to fully fund their plans if they agreed not to freeze benefits. Pension plans were hurt last year by the declines in the financial markets, leaving employers hungry for cash to compensate for pension fund losses but with few places to look outside of staff reductions or cuts to benefits.\n\nWhile delaying pension contributions would ease that cash squeeze, it would impose more risks on the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the government body that pays retirees\u00d5 benefits when a company\u00d5s pension plan fails. Since 1974, the corporation, which is funded by premiums paid by businesses, has saved the pension plans of about 4,000 companies. It has a deficit of $33.5 billion.\n\nIf companies and their pension plans continue to collapse at a rapid rate, many economists worry that the corporation would eventually need a taxpayer bailout.\n\nHowever, at a meeting Thursday of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, lawmakers appeared sympathetic to granting employers more time to make payments.\n\n\u00d2We are asking them to put more money aside for the pensions, and that\u00d5s money that can\u00d5t be used to create jobs,\u00d3 said Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat. \u00d2You want to give them some flexibility and some relief.\u00d3\n\nLawmakers said they were moved by the stories of workers at Delphi, the auto parts giant where 21,000 salaried workers and retirees are facing retirement checks that are significantly lower than they expected. The reduced pensions are a result of the bankruptcy of Delphi, which underfunded its plan and turned over responsibility for retirement accounts to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which limits the monthly stipends for certain retirees.\n\nThe pensions of all Delphi workers will not be cut. The 46,000 union members will receive full retirement benefits because of a decade-old deal with General Motors, the former parent company of Delphi, which agreed to make up any shortfalls if Delphi ever encountered financial trouble.\n\nBruce Gump, who leads a group of retired nonunion Delphi workers, told the committee that he believed the government had acted illegally by allowing their retirement checks to be cut.\n\n\u00d2What we\u00d5re asking for is fair and equitable treatment,\u00d3 Mr. Gump said. \u00d2Honest, hard-working, play-by-the-rules American citizens are paying a terrible price.\u00d3\n\nThe bill was introduced by Representative Earl Pomeroy, a North Dakota Democrat, and Representative Pat Tiberi, an Ohio Republican.\n\nChanging the pension system is familiar terrain for legislators. In 2006, lawmakers passed rules intended to require companies to fully fund their pensions over seven years, after an initial delay. Congress was trying to address shortfalls at many companies, which became apparent after the collapse of airlines and steel makers.\n\nBut when the markets plunged last year, lawmakers rushed to ease some of those restrictions and give employers more flexibility in how quickly they had to meet funding thresholds.\n\nSenator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, said at Thursday\u00d5s hearing that lawmakers had to make adjustments. \u00d2If we could have foreseen in 2006 the steep stock market decline coming around the bend, then there is little doubt that we would have incorporated greater flexibility in the funding rules,\u00d3 he said.\n\nJeremy Gold, an actuary and economist, said lawmakers were ignoring the potential benefits of devoting more money to pension plans.\n\n\u00d2One of biggest arguments is this funding relief saves jobs,\u00d3 Mr. Gold said. \u00d2That may be true for troubled employers, but when you put money into pension plans, it goes into the capital markets and makes capital cheaper.\u00d3 "}

AT&T said it earned $3.19 billion, or 54 cents a share, in the third quarter as the Apple iPhone helped attract two million new wireless customers. Its profit topped Wall Street forecasts for 50 cents a share.\n\nAdding to the optimism, a report on leading economic indicators released Thursday showed an improved outlook for the general health of the economy.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 131.95 points, or 1.33 percent, to 10,081.31, one day after it closed below 10,000.

The Nasdaq composite index gained 14.56 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,165.29.\n\nAt the same time, several banks and energy companies, including Fifth Third Bank and Consol Energy, showed disappointing earnings, but share prices of energy and utilities rebounded as the broad market rallied late in the session. Financial stocks drove much of the increase, as did better-than-expected reports from heavyweights like McDonald's and 3M.\n\nAfter the market closed, there were more optimistic signs in quarterly reports from American Express and Capital One.\n\nEBay surprised investors when it reported its earnings had dropped 29 percent, to $349.7 million, or 27 cents a share. Shares of eBay fell $1.06, or 4.23 percent, to $23.97. Amazon.com, by contrast, outpaced expectations, and investors said strong retail sales were boding well for the holiday season.\n\nSeveral large companies, including the cigarette producer Philip Morris International, Xerox, and Dow Chemical, reported diminishing sales, but still outpaced expectations.\n\nThe generally upbeat company reports seemed to eclipse data from the Labor Department showing that the number of newly laid off workers filing jobless claims last week rose to 531,000 from 520,000 a week earlier. That figure was higher than economists had predicted, and it led to concern that the unemployment rate would continue its march upward.\n\nInvestors seemed to mostly ignore that bit of news, however, propelling stocks upward.\n\n''The sentiment right now is to drive this thing home strong and that remains constant and consistent,'' said Randy Cass, founder of First Coverage, which is based in Boson. ''Unless there is a completely unbelievable data point, they're not getting the heebie-jeebies.''\n\nStill, the jobless numbers were distressing to some investors.\n\n''The pickup there is definitely concerning,'' said Jeffrey A. Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader's Almanac. ''It probably surprised a few people more so than they're willing to admit.''\n\nOverseas, the Nikkei stock average in Japan fell 0.64 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain declined 0.96 percent, the DAX in Germany index fell 1.21 percent, and the CAC-40 in France dropped 1.35 percent.\n\nThe dollar, which fell to $1.50 against the euro on Wednesday, its lowest level in more than a year, continued to teeter at that threshold, though it rebounded slightly early in the day, prompting investors to turn away from other commodities like gold and oil. By the end of Thursday, it had returned to $1.50.\n\nThe price of crude oil hovered at $81.23, down slightly.\n\nInterest rates were little changed. The Treasury's 10-year note fell 7/32, to 101 24/32, and the yield rose to 3.41 from 3.39 late Wednesday. "}

Then over the course of a few minutes, Kamai Pugh, 7, took Simon apart and transformed the array of blue blocks and foam noodles into a child\u00d5s vision of a miniature park with swing sets, a weighing scale, a balance beam, a swimming pool and finally, a lime-green airplane.\n\nIn Brownsville, Brooklyn, a portable version of Imagination Playground features oversize but lightweight building blocks.\n\nAt the Imagination Playground in a Box, no fantasy seems too far-fetched. The colorful gear, which arrived at the Brownsville Recreation Center in Brooklyn last week and will remain there through Labor Day, is designed to unleash creativity by allowing children to invent their own activities.\n\nInstead of plummeting down slides or dangling from the monkey bars, children on Saturday built polyethylene palaces from blocks shaped like triangles, clovers, rectangles and cylinders.\n\nThey became instant abstractionists, using sturdy brushes to mix heaps of wet sand with colored chalk on the cement. And the urban planners-in-training among them took turns toying with hoses and blocks to create water irrigation systems.\n\nThe Brownsville play center gave children a taste of what the architect David Rockwell hopes will revolutionize playground design. Mr. Rockwell, who designed the playground, brought his portable, neon-painted toy chests to Brownsville in partnership with the parks department. In the fall of 2009, a 15,000-square-foot, figure-eight-shaped permanent Imagination Playground is scheduled to open at Burling Slip in Lower Manhattan.\n\nMr. Rockwell hopes that eventually, with the help of the nonprofit playground developer Kaboom, his playgrounds will be replicated across the country. \u00d2I think we\u00d5re living in this highly technological, highly programmed world,\u00d3 Mr. Rockwell said in a telephone interview. \u00d2This kind of low-tech, hands-on creative freedom is incredibly empowering for kids.\u00d3\n\nThe portable playground in Brownsville, which included about 150 pieces \u00d1 the largest about three feet long, and none weighing more than a pound or so \u00d1 earned high marks from children, though they said it should complement, not replace, jungle gyms.\n\nThe children said they liked creating their own foam worlds and being able to tear them down on a whim and start anew. They also appreciated the cushiony feel of the pieces, which prevented scrapes and, they said, removed any shred of guilt from pounding each other with the noodles in gladiator-style fights.\n\nSitting on of her green airplane, Kamai Pugh said she liked to play with other children to create clubhouses \u00d1 one for the boys and one for the girls. She said that she wanted to be a fashion designer one day and that the playground helped her explore her creative side.\n\n\u00d2I like to draw, and I like to sew,\u00d3 she said. \u00d2This helps me be a designer so I can be on TV and have the best design.\u00d3\n\nKamai\u00d5s mother, Karen Pugh, said she was surprised at the camaraderie the children developed by working together. \u00d2As a mother, you know what intrigues your child\u00d5s mind,\u00d3 Ms. Pugh said. \u00d2These things really seem to help her create and to gear minds toward thinking about new possibilities.\u00d3\n\nAnother parent, Preme Brewster, said the play gear was attractive even to adults, who can use it for exercise or perhaps build alongside the children.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s so bright, you want to pick it up and play with it yourself,\u00d3 Ms. Brewster said.\n\nAbout 40 children have come to the new playground each day since it opened last Wednesday, and word is slowly trickling through the neighborhood, said a playground supervisor, Jamaal Pinckney, 27.\n\nMr. Pinckney, who lives in Brooklyn, said the playground was particularly welcome in a neighborhood that had struggled with violence and drugs and what he called a \u00d2thug mentality\u00d3 among young people.\n\n\u00d2They have a chance to come out here and just be free and just envision all that you can do,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2Here, life is unlimited.\u00d3\n\nMr. Pinckney stood near the fence watching Rakeem Marshall, 13, and his stepbrother, Ocyrus Minto, 9, build a ramp leading to a pit of foam noodles.

{"klass": "javier_c_hernandez", "text": "The United States trade deficit in September widened more than expected, to $36.5 billion, in part because of an increase in oil prices, the Commerce Department said Friday.\n\nThe department\u00d5s data showed an 18.2 percent jump in the gap between the value of imports and exports, known as the trade balance.\n\nBoth imports and exports rose, but an increase in the price of oil weighed significantly on the statistics. Oil prices increased to $68.17 a barrel in September from $64.75 in August. As a result, the United States imported $19.51 billion in oil in September, up from $17.38 billion in August.\n\nOverall, imports rose 5.8 percent in September to $168.4 billion from $159.1 billion, and exports grew 2.9 percent, to $132 billion from $128.3 billion \u00d1 a significant increase that indicated higher demand for American products abroad, including autos, aircraft and industrial machinery.\n\nAs of September, the trade deficit is running at an annual rate of $366 billion, about half of last year\u00d5s $695.9 billion. The deficit with China, which had been easing, rose 9.2 percent to $22.1 billion last month.\n\nWhile the economy remains weak, Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass., said he saw reason for optimism in the numbers. The rise in imports, he said, indicated that manufacturers in the United States were building up inventories \u00d1 a carmaker importing Japanese auto parts, for instance \u00d1 in anticipation of higher demand from American consumers.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s a very strong signal that the domestic economy is recovering,\u00d3 he said.\n\nMr. Behravesh said he expected the appetite for imported goods would recede as the economy stabilizes, and that he believed exports would continue to climb.\n\nJosh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said the large deficits with China were worrisome. China has made a habit of snapping up dollars in an effort to weaken its currency \u00d1 the yuan \u00d1 against the dollar. A cheap yuan makes Chinese goods overseas cheaper and increases their appeal to United States consumers.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s bad for both countries,\u00d3 Mr. Bivens said. \u00d2It\u00d5s money they could be spending somewhere else more valuably, in public infrastructure or public capital.\u00d3\n\nPresident Obama is in Asia this week, where he plans to tackle that very subject and make the case for weaning Asian economies off of demand from American consumers to balance the global economy.\n\nAs the dollar continues to drop against other major world currencies, companies in the United States are hoping to take advantage of its dwindling value.\n\nA weak dollar makes the price of foreign goods like French wine and Japanese cars more expensive in the United States, driving consumers toward American brands. Overseas, it makes United States exports like corn and mining trucks cheaper, helping sales for American companies.\n\nBut a bounce in exports may not come as quickly as some producers would like.\n\nJohn H. Dobson, president of the American Soybean Association, said he took the news of a weak dollar as a positive sign.\n\n\u00d2I hope that we will be able to catch up and see strong export growth,\u00d3 Mr. Dobson said. Exports of soybeans, as well as corn, fell slightly in September.\n\nHowever, he said the weak dollar meant soybean growers would have to pay more overseas for things like fertilizer and machine parts, and he worried that there was a limit to the demand for soybeans worldwide, even if they were cheaper to foreign consumers.\n\nDermot Hayes, a professor of economics and finance at Iowa State University who specializes agricultural economics, said the global malaise could slow what might otherwise be a positive for American exporters.\n\n\u00d2If it weren\u00d5t for these other impediments in the crisis, we should have seen a big increase in exports,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2But it also takes awhile to produce stuff. You have to ramp up production and grow more acres and grow more pigs and more cows and that takes time.\u00d3\n\nPolicy makers in Washington have seemed content to let the dollar slide, so long as it does not fall at such a rapid pace that it wreaks havoc on world economies. The Federal Reserve has kept its interest rates at historic lows, helping to contribute to a weak dollar as investors transfer their wealth to the world\u00d5s booming stock markets.\n\nIn Asia this week, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner reiterated his support for a strong dollar in the face of criticism from the finance ministers of other nations, who hold much of their foreign investments in United States dollars.\n\nIn August, the deficit narrowed unexpectedly as Americans cut back on foreign oil. On Friday, the Commerce Department revised the August deficit to $30.71 billion."}
{"klass": "javier_c_hernandez", "text": " If the economy is getting stronger, why is the dollar getting weaker?\n\nTraders on Monday on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. All of the American major indexes finished the day higher.\n\nAs the stock market surged anew on Monday and into Tuesday, and the price of gold marched ever higher, the dollar took its biggest tumble since July. The American currency sank roughly 1 percent against other major currencies, to its lowest level since the financial crisis broke out more than a year ago.\n\nBut the seeming disconnect between the value of the dollar and the value of stocks is, in fact, not much of a disconnect at all. A growing belief that wealthy nations like the United States will forge ahead with efforts to revive economic growth is luring risk-shy investors back into the world\u00d5s stock markets. But with interest rates down and government spending up, the dollar is swooning. Many market participants assert that the currency is weakening with tacit approval from Washington policy makers.\n\nWhile the faltering dollar will make everything from French wine to Korean televisions more expensive for American consumers, it will also make American exports more competitive overseas \u00d1 a lift for multinational corporations like Caterpillar, Intel and Pepsi.\n\nIndeed, shares of multinationals paced a stock market rally on Monday that left some analysts wondering if a new bull market was building. The Dow leapt 203.52 points, or 2 percent, to 10,226.94, its highest level since October 2008. The broader Standard and Poor\u00d5s 500-stock index rose 23.78 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,093.08. The Nasdaq composite index was up 41.62 points or 1.97 percent, at 2,154.06. And Asian markets opened strong Tuesday, with Japan\u00d5s Nikkei index rising 1.3 percent.\n\nIf the stock market seems volatile lately, that is because it is. Since early September, the Dow has surged or plunged more than 1 percent during 18 separate trading sessions.\n\nBut while stocks seem to have regained their footing \u00d1 the Dow industrials are now up 16.5 percent for the year \u00d1 the dollar, once quite literally the gold standard of world currencies, is in retreat. The dollar has lost 16 percent of its value since March. It was hovering around $1.50 against the euro Monday.\n\nIn the \u00d2bad news is good news\u00d3 paradigm of Wall Street, the dollar\u00d5s fall against nearly all the major currencies reflects the growing belief that major governments will keep interest rates low into 2010 and increase spending to revive growth. A weekend communiqu\u008e from the finance ministers of the Group of 20 wealthiest nations offered little support for the dollar: the G20 affirmed its support for keeping stimulus efforts in place but was silent on the dollar\u00d5s prospects.\n\nSome investors read the statement as a sign that governments would let the dollar weaken more, without intervening in the currency markets.\n\n\u00d2It was a deafening silence, another excuse to investors to keep selling the dollar,\u00d3 said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist for Forex.com. \u00d2A lot of it is sentiment-driven, and there the dollar is getting a vote of no confidence.\u00d3\n\nA currency is usually regarded as a barometer of a country\u00d5s economic conditions. The stronger the currency, the thinking goes, the stronger the economy, and vice versa. But while a precipitous decline in the dollar might wreak havoc in the American economy and the markets, a moderate decline does not seem to be a big worry for Washington. Indeed, many economists contend that a devalued dollar helped the United States recover from the Great Depression.\n\nAs the dollar has fallen recently, the price of gold, which has been on a tear in recent weeks, surged to yet another record. The metal reached $1,103.65 an ounce in late afternoon trading. Its price has fluttered at record highs lately amid a frenzy for it by hedge funds and wealthy speculators. Other commodities also rose, with the price of oil flirting with $80 a barrel.\n\nRock-bottom interest rates in the United States have cemented the dollar\u00d5s reputation as a low-yield investment. Last week, in assessing the overall health of the economy, the Federal Reserve gave no indication that it planned to raise interest rates in the near future, stirring concern over inflation and prompting investors to reroute their funds toward gold, oil and the stocks.\n\n\u00d2When you have zero percent inflation, zero percent interest rates, zero percent money markets rates, and when you have metals and gold that have skyrocketed to astronomical levels, stocks look pretty good in comparison,\u00d3 said M. Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Okla.\n\nBut for some investors, a swelling budget deficit and low interest rates are a recipe for future inflation, which would erode the dollar\u00d5s value further.\n\nIn the midst of the crisis last year, investors the world over flocked to havens like United States Treasury notes. But now, with confidence growing about the global economy, many are shifting funds back into stocks, including many emerging markets. Brazil\u00d5s stock market, for instance, has jumped more than 11 percent in the last five days.\n\n\u00d2If the world continues to heal, and investor confidence continues to rise, you will continue to see money leaving the safe, liquid arms of the U.S. Treasury and going back overseas in search of better returns and higher yields,\u00d3 said Rebecca Patterson, global head of foreign exchange and commodities at JPMorgan\u00d5s private bank.\n\nPolicy makers, meanwhile, may face pressure to intervene if the dollar plunges too rapidly. But in the short term, they may see political and economic benefits in a slow but steady depreciation of the currency: a falling dollar could push up exports and send customers at home flocking to American brands.\n\nThe Treasury\u00d5s 10-year note rose 3/32 to 101 4/32. The yield fell to 3.49 percent, from 3.50 percent late Friday."}
{"klass": "javier_c_hernandez", "text": "The New York City comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., released a report on Tuesday suggesting that the city\u00d5s graduation rate was inflated, saying he had found instances where it appeared schools had wrongly changed student grades and improperly awarded credit.\n\nBut Mr. Thompson, a candidate for mayor, did not point to any conclusive evidence of manipulation, saying only that a lack of oversight, coupled with intense pressure to push up the graduation rate, created the potential for abuse. And he acknowledged that, by and large, the schools examined in his report were awarding diplomas only to students who had met graduation requirements.\n\nStill, Mr. Thompson cautioned, the city was not monitoring students\u00d5 records scrupulously enough and the record-keeping system was disorganized and prone to inaccuracy.\n\n\u00d2The mayor\u00d5s managerial style has created an incentive for schools to graduate students whether or not they have met the requirements,\u00d3 Mr. Thompson said at a news conference. \u00d2A New York City high school diploma is supposed to represent one standard.\u00d3\n\nIn a 38-page rebuttal, the city\u00d5s Department of Education defended its graduation rate, which has climbed to the highest level in decades (56 percent in 2008, up 10 percentage points since 2005).\n\nJennifer Bell-Ellwanger, the education official who wrote the rebuttal, said Mr. Thompson had misinterpreted how schools maintain records.\n\n\u00d2The comptroller focuses his report almost exclusively on minor quibbles,\u00d3 Ms. Bell-Ellwanger wrote, \u00d2and raising unwarranted, unfair suspicions regarding school conduct, based on cursory and incomplete inquiry.\u00d3\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday evening, Mr. Thompson also called for the firing of the schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, in part because of the findings in the report. He said Mr. Klein, a lawyer, had failed to run the Education Department in a transparent manner and had shut parents out of the system.\n\n\u00d2I think it is time to go back to a chancellor who is an educator,\u00d3 he said.\n\nMr. Thompson, a Democrat, has been criticized for running a subdued campaign in his effort to unseat Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.\n\nThe mayor often trumpets increased test scores and the graduation rate as a hallmark of his tenure, and he has made his education accomplishments a focal point of his re-election campaign.\n\nMr. Thompson appears to be trying to undermine that talking point, issuing a string of news releases questioning the progress in the schools during Mr. Bloomberg\u00d5s watch.\n\nThe graduation rate report released on Tuesday was no exception. A news release from the comptroller\u00d5s office said it was \u00d2blistering audit,\u00d3 asking, in capital letters: \u00d2Did graduates actually meet all requirements to earn their diplomas?\u00d3 At the news conference, Mr. Thompson called the city\u00d5s school system the \u00d2Enron of American education.\u00d3\n\nMr. Bloomberg\u00d5s re-election campaign quickly responded, issuing a statement attacking Mr. Thompson\u00d5s record as president of the city\u00d5s Board of Education in the 1990s and saying the report was based on \u00d2phony attacks.\u00d3\n\nMr. Thompson\u00d5s yearlong audit of 197 students from the class of 2007 found insufficient evidence to verify that 19 of the students had met requirements for graduation. Education officials eventually provided enough documentation to convince Mr. Thompson that at least 17 of those students had met the requirements, but the comptroller said he had no indication that schools had assembled the information before awarding diplomas.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Thompson\u00d5s report found that 18 percent of the students in the study were given credit for repeating courses they had passed. Department of Education officials disputed that claim. In one instance, Mr. Thompson, said a student was twice given credit for English 4, but education officials said the student had taken one of those courses at summer school, and that the course content had been different.\n\nMr. Thompson also argued that 25 percent of student transcripts he studied were altered before or after graduation, and that educators were not submitting proper grade-change forms. But education officials said changes to transcripts were part of regular reviews of student data at the end of the year as school officials entered the information and found errors.\n\nMr. Thompson also took aim at the city\u00d5s dropout rate, which he said was artificially low. He said the city had overstated the number of students who had transferred to private schools or moved from the city, known as \u00d2discharges.\u00d3 Mr. Thompson accepted the city\u00d5s explanation for 13 of the 14 cases that he challenged, but said he was concerned education officials had classified them as discharges without proper documentation.\n\nMr. Thompson called on the city to better monitor student transcripts and institute citywide policies on how course credits are earned. Education officials said that their practices were already in compliance with state law, and that the comptroller\u00d5s demands exceeded those requirements.\n\nEducation officials also said there was no evidence that schools had made decisions to graduate any students without consulting the proper documents.\n\nTo graduate, students must earn 44 credits and pass Regents exams.\n\nA frequent criticism is the city\u00d5s use of credit makeup programs, which allow students to complete packets of worksheets or enroll in weeklong cram sessions over holiday breaks to earn credit for courses they have failed.\n\nSome educators say the programs have eroded the rigor of academic programs and allowed students to accumulate credits when they have not mastered the material. But the city noted that graduation requires more than credits, and that any such abuse is not widespread enough to affect the graduation rate."}
{"klass": "javier_c_hernandez", "text": " The National Park Service has started inching closer to reopening the Statue of Liberty's crown for the first time since the 9/11 attacks by seeking ways to make access safer.\n\nThe park service is seeking bids from engineers and architects to study whether alterations to the crown would make it safer for visitors to evacuate in case of an emergency. The crown is currently accessible only by a narrow, double-helix-shaped staircase that is not in compliance with federal, state or city fire and building codes. The issue of whether the stairway was ever in compliance was not raised publicly until after 9/11.\n\nIf changes to the statue are not practical, the park service will look for other ways of minimizing the dangers, possibly by limiting the number of visitors.\n\nThe park service acknowledged it was considering reopening the crown after Representative Anthony D. Weiner provided reporters on Friday with a copy of the agency's request for proposals. The Daily News reported the park service's decision on Friday.\n\nMr. Weiner, during a news conference on Friday in Battery Park with the statue behind him, said the off-limits crown was an ''embarrassment'' to the city and demonstrated a ''lack of creativity and imagination'' on the part of the park service.\n\nMr. Weiner, a Democrat who represents parts of Queens and Brooklyn, helped arrange a Congressional hearing in September on reopening the crown.\n\n''Something that many of us remember from our youth -- going up those narrow stairwells, getting up on our tippy-toes, looking out through the crown to one of the most glorious vistas you can imagine,'' Mr. Weiner said, ''that experience has been denied to visitors now for seven Fourth of Julys.''\n\nAs possible solutions, Mr. Weiner suggested caps on the number of visitors, strict height and weight guidelines and requiring visitors to sign waivers acknowledging the risks.\n\nLiberty Island was closed to the public after the 9/11 attacks. The statue's base reopened on Aug. 3, 2004, after a $20 million effort to improve fire safety, security and evacuation routes. But the crown remained closed because the park service said it posed a potentially catastrophic hazard to visitors.\n\nThe decision to look at the feasibility of reopening the crown came in response to a request by Congress at the September hearing, David Barna, a spokesman for the park service, said on Friday. He said the park service wants to have a study on reopening the crown completed by January.\n\nAdvocates who have sought the reopening praised the decision but said they hoped the park service would find a way to open the crown before any renovations were completed -- a move the park service said it was not considering.\n\nAlexander R. Brash, the northeast regional director of the National Parks Conservation Association, said, ''We think it is high time to open the crown, and certainly by next Independence Day at the very latest.'' He added, ''The more people who can experience it, the more awe-inspiring their visit to the statue, the better.''\n\nWhen the roughly 10 flights of steps leading to the crown from the top of the pedestal were open to the public, park rangers were regularly faced with visitors with medical problems, including those with heat exhaustion, panic attacks and claustrophobia, according to a park service statement. The park service said the stairs were originally intended to be used by maintenance workers.\n\nThe statement, issued on Friday, noted that the statue's creator, Fr\u008ed\u008eric Auguste Bartholdi, never envisioned visitors climbing to the crown.

The dollar remained weak, and a rush for gold slowed slightly.\n\nAt the end, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 20.03 points, or 0.2 percent, at 10,246.97. The broader Standard and Poor\u00d5s 500-stock index declined less than a point to 1,093.01, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 2.98 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,151.08.\n\nThe stock exchanges will be open Wednesday on Veteran\u00d5s Day, but the bond markets will be closed.\n\nShares of financial companies, particularly regional banks, were among laggards.

American Express rose 1.6 percent, to $39.68, on reports that worldwide credit card spending had increased by 3 percent in October \u00d1 a sign that consumers might be more optimistic about spending.\n\nThe dollar, which has lost 16 percent of its value since March, continued to trade near $1.50 against the euro and fell against other currencies as well. While the dollar is considered a safe-haven investment, low interest rates have kept its yield down, and in response investors have thrown their money to Wall Street in search of higher returns. The price of gold, which in recent weeks has hit record highs nearly every day, climbed slightly, to $1,105.60 an ounce.\n\nEven as the stock market continues an eight-month rally, there are concerns over the speed of a recovery.

Janet Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve in San Francisco, said growth was sustainable but that it would not happen fast enough to bring down unemployment anytime soon.\n\n\u00d2High unemployment, weak job growth and paltry wage increases are a recipe for sluggish consumer spending growth and a tepid recovery,\u00d3 Ms. Yellen told a real estate group in Phoenix.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Senator Christopher J.

And the Lloyds Banking Group\u00d5s shares dropped slightly after the bank announced plans to lay off an additional 5,000 workers.\n\nKen Mayland, president of ClearView Economics in Ohio, said Wall Street would probably continue to inch upward, with occasional downturns, as investors gunned for a strong finish to 2009.\n\n\u00d2There\u00d5s a lot of money on the sidelines that has missed out on stocks being up,\u00d3 Mr. Mayland said. \u00d2And time to the year-end is getting short.\u00d3\n\nThe Treasury\u00d5s 10-year note rose 4/32, to 101 8/32.

Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for Gluskin Sheff & Associates, an investment firm, said the housing numbers raised questions about the strength of the underlying economy.\n\n\u00d2It tells you a thing or two about how reliant we are on the government sector for prosperity,\u00d3 Mr. Rosenberg said. \u00d2It\u00d5s still extremely difficult to get a sense of what the U.S. economy looks like organically.\u00d3\n\nOverseas, markets were mostly down. The CAC 40 in France was flat, the FTSE 100 in Britain fell 0.1 percent, and the DAX in Germany climbed 0.2 percent.\n\nGold continued to make gains, climbing to $1,145.50, as investors looked for a safe haven for their money. Oil increased slightly, to $79.58 a barrel. The dollar fell against other world currencies, trading at slightly less than $1.50 against the euro, even as United States policy makers in recent days have reiterated support for the currency.\n\nOn Tuesday, Wall Street indexes reached highs for 2009, largely because of a surge in commodity prices that helped buoy shares of energy and materials companies.\n\nThe Treasury\u00d5s 10-year note fell 11/32, to 100 3/32. The yield rose to 3.36 percent, from 3.32 percent late Tuesday."}
