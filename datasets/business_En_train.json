{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "First hedge funds battled the markets. Now they are battling Washington.\n\nAfter a tumultuous run for many of these funds, this normally secretive corner of Wall Street is mobilizing its money and power to fend off tougher oversight, higher taxes and much greater transparency.\n\nAt the center of the fray is Richard H. Baker, the former Republican congressman who now leads the industry\u00d5s main lobbying group, the Managed Funds Association.\n\nThis year Mr. Baker has tried to persuade hedge fund managers to support proposals to require funds to register with federal regulators \u00d1 a move some big funds did not initially support, but one many others see as a bargaining chip that could avert even tougher restrictions.\n\nMr. Baker has also met with Treasury officials and has been the host of gatherings to raise money for Christopher J. Dodd, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. He has events planned for Barney Frank, the Democratic leader of the House Financial Services Committee, and Mr. Frank\u00d5s Republican counterpart, Richard C. Shelby.\n\nThe effort seems to be working. The proposals for hedge funds laid out by the Obama administration last week, as part of its overhaul of financial regulation, are strikingly similar to those that hedge fund lobbyists said they would accept. In an interview, Mr. Baker said that hedge funds were simply catching up in Washington with other financial companies, like banks and mutual funds, which have lobbied successfully for years.\n\n\u00d2They were much more engaged and successful on that front than we were,\u00d3 said Mr. Baker, the former chairman of a subcommittee of the House Financial Services committee.\n\nDonations in the industry have long been slanted toward Democratic candidates, and $11 million of last year\u00d5s nearly $17 million in donations were doled out to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nIn the last two years, fund managers have also spent about $15 million on lobbyists, quadruple the amount they spent in past years.\n\nThe registration of hedge funds, as well as private equity firms, has figured prominently in discussions of reform for years. Mr. Baker himself wrote it into a bill back in 1999, after the near collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management prompted federal officials to broker a Wall Street-led rescue.\n\nMandatory registration has been discussed for so long, in fact, that many in the industry regard it as the issue to fight over to avoid other, more pressing matters.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s a red herring,\u00d3 said Robert Sloan, managing partner at S3, which helps hedge funds manage their positions. \u00d2What other business in the world doesn\u00d5t want to register its name and number, the mafia? The real issues are counterparties, leverage, shorting, derivatives and exchanges.\u00d3\n\nThe Citadel Investment Group has been focused on those issues. Kenneth C. Griffin, the Citadel chief executive, testified in Congress about derivatives trading on Monday.\n\nPeople who study the industry wonder if the hedge fund operators can stick together. Two years ago, funds split into competing groups after disagreements about the Managed Funds Association\u00d5s positions.\n\nOne of the groups, led by James Chanos, the prominent short-seller who runs Kynikos Associates, was an early supporter of registration. The group, called the Coalition of Private Investment Companies, has put up Web sites recently to educate the public on hedge funds and short-selling.\n\nAlso two years ago, some hedge funds split away from the association into a group to fight proposals to change the so-called carried-interest tax, which allows partnerships to pay capital gains taxes on income they earn over time. That loophole \u00d1 under debate again in this Congress \u00d1 generates billions of dollars in gains to hedge funds and private equity firms.\n\nThe Tudor Investment Group, one of the few funds to have set up its own political action committee, was an ardent opponent of the change. An economist from Tudor, Robert McNally, toured Washington last year using his expertise on oil as an entree but steering conversations quickly to carried interest, according to Congressional staff members.\n\nOther hedge fund chiefs have visited the Hill on their own lately. James Simons, the former mathematics professor who runs Renaissance, met with lawmakers from a subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee this month. And lobbyists for the Private Equity Council, which is trying to differentiate its members from hedge funds, met recently with staff members on that same committee.\n\nMr. Baker\u00d5s association listed a dozen bills as being of interest in an April lobbying disclosure form, that put its lobbying spending at $750,000 a quarter. Since then, other issues have arisen, like hedge fund rules in Europe that hedge funds have asked the Treasury Department to oppose. A spokesman for the Treasury Department said the Treasury met not only with hedge funds, but with other groups as well.\n\nMr. Baker said in an interview that if the carried-interest tax loophole were closed, he would push for a delay before doing so.\n\nHe also said no hedge funds should be deemed \u00d2systemically important,\u00d3 a designation that would open them to greater scrutiny under the Obama administration\u00d5s proposals. People who follow the industry dismiss his position as jockeying.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s disingenuous for anyone to claim in this day and age that no hedge fund is systemically important,\u00d3 said Andrew W. Lo, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied hedge funds for more than a decade. \u00d2Frankly I don\u00d5t think any hedge fund manager in his right mind could argue that the industry needs no oversight.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": " The inspector general who oversees the government's bailout of the banking system is criticizing the Treasury Department for some misleading public statements last fall and raising the possibility that it had unfairly disbursed money to the biggest banks.\n\nA Treasury official made incorrect statements about the health of the nation's biggest banks even as the government was doling out billions of dollars in aid, according to a report on the Troubled Asset Relief Program to be released on Monday by the special inspector general, Neil M. Barofksy.\n\nThe report also provides new insight into the way the Treasury allocated billions of dollars to nine of Wall Street's largest players. The report says that Bank of America appeared to qualify for more aid earlier, under the government plan. That assertion adds another element of intrigue to continuing investigations of the bank's merger with Merrill Lynch and the role that regulators played in the deal, even as Merrill's condition deteriorated.\n\nThe bailout formula called for banks to get an amount equal to as much as 3 percent of their risk-weighted assets, with aid capped at $25 billion for each institution, according to the report. By size, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America could have qualified for more, and the first two received $25 billion.\n\nBut Bank of America was given only $15 billion in October, since Merrill Lynch was earmarked for $10 billion. The two companies agreed to a merger, though their deal had not yet been approved by regulators or shareholders.\n\nBank of America ultimately received Merrill's $10 billion in January -- as well as $20 billion in additional bailout funds -- but if the bank had not been involved in the Merrill deal, it would probably have received $25 billion at the outset, as did Citigroup and JPMorgan.\n\nAnother company in the process of a merger was not treated the same. Wells Fargo was acquiring Wachovia, and it received both companies' money at the start, according to the inspector general.\n\nMr. Barofsky's office also says that regulators were wrong to tell the public last year that the earliest bailout recipients were all healthy.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., for instance, said on Oct. 14 that the banks were ''healthy,'' and that they accepted the money for ''the good of the U.S. economy.'' The banks, he said, would be better able to increase their lending to consumers and businesses.\n\nIn truth, regulators were concerned about the health of several banks that received that first bailout, the inspector general writes.\n\nThe inspector general said government officials need to be more careful when describing their actions and rationale. In a letter included with the report, the Federal Reserve concurred with Mr. Barofsky's concern about the statements made last year, but the Treasury Department said that any review of announcements last year ''must be considered in light of the unprecedented circumstances in which they were made.''\n\nCorrection: October 7, 2009, Wednesday An article on Monday about criticisms of the Treasury Department by the inspector general who oversees the government's bailout of the banking system misspelled the inspector general's surname on first reference. He is Neil M. Barofsky, not Barofksy."}

Then, in what might seem an act of charity, the funds are helping homeowners by reducing the size of the loans.\n\nBut as part of these deals, the mortgages are being refinanced through lenders that work with government agencies like the Federal Housing Administration. This enables the funds to pocket sizable profits by reselling new, government-insured loans to other federal agencies, which then bundle the mortgages into securities for sale to investors.\n\nWhile homeowners save money, the arrangement shifts nearly all the risk for the loans to the federal government \u00d1 and, ultimately, taxpayers \u00d1 at a time when Americans are falling behind on their mortgage payments in record numbers.\n\nFor instance, a fund might offer to pay $40 million for a $100 million block of mortgages from a bank in distress. Then the fund could arrange to have some of those loans refinanced into mortgages backed by an agency like the F.H.A. and then sold to an agency like Ginnie Mae. The trick is to persuade the homeowners to refinance those mortgages, by offering to reduce the amounts the homeowners owe.\n\nThe profit comes when the refinancings reach more than the $40 million that the fund paid for the block of loans.\n\nThe strategy has created an unusual alliance between Wall Street funds that specialize in troubled investments \u00d1 the industry calls them \u00d2vulture\u00d3 funds \u00d1 and American homeowners.\n\nBut the transactions also add to the potential burden on government agencies, particularly the F.H.A., which has lately taken on an outsize role in the housing market and, some fear, may eventually need to be bailed out at taxpayer expense.\n\nThese new mortgage investors thrive in the shadows. Typically, the funds employ intermediaries to contact homeowners and arrange for mortgages to be refinanced.\n\nHomeowners often have no idea who their Wall Street benefactors are. Federal housing officials, too, are in the dark.\n\nPolicymakers have encouraged investors and banks to put more consumers into government-backed loans. The total value of these transactions from hedge funds is small compared with the overall housing market.\n\nHousing experts warn that the financial players involved \u00d1 the investment funds, their intermediaries and certain F.H.A. approved lenders \u00d1 have a financial incentive to put as many loans as possible into the government\u00d5s hands.\n\n\u00d2From the borrower\u00d5s point of view, landing in a hedge fund or private equity fund that\u00d5s willing to write down principal is a gift,\u00d3 said Howard Glaser, a financial industry consultant and former official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nHe went on: \u00d2From the systemic point of view, there is something disturbing about investors that had substantial short-term profit in backing toxic loans now swooping down to make another profit on cleaning up that mess.\u00d3\n\nSteven and Marisela Alva say they do not know who helped them with their mortgage. All they know is that they feel blessed.\n\nLast December, the couple got a letter saying that a firm had purchased the mortgage on their home in Pico Rivera, Calif., from Chase Home Finance for less than its original value. \u00d2We want to share this discount with you,\u00d3 the letter said.\n\n\u00d2I couldn\u00d5t believe it,\u00d3 said Mr. Alva, a 62-year-old janitor and father of three. \u00d2I kept thinking to myself, \u00d4Something is wrong, something is wrong. This sounds too good.\u00d5 \u00d3\n\nBut it was true. The balance on the Alvas\u00d5 mortgage was ultimately reduced to $314,000 from $440,000.\n\nThe firm behind the reduction remains a mystery. The Alvas\u00d5 new loan, backed by the F.H.A., was made by Primary Residential Mortgage, a lender based in Utah. But the letter came from a company called MCM Capital Partners.\n\nIn the letter, MCM said the couple\u00d5s loan was owned by something called MCMCap Homeowners\u00d5 Advantage Trust III. But MCM\u00d5s co-founders said in an interview that MCM does not own any mortgages. They would not reveal the investor that owned the Alvas\u00d5 loan because they had agreed to keep that client\u00d5s identity confidential.\n\nMichael Niccolini, an MCM founder, said, \u00d2We are changing people\u00d5s lives.\u00d3 "}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": " One year and two bailouts later, Bank of America is moving to extricate itself from Washington's grip.\n\nWith the financial industry on the mend, the giant bank announced several measures on Monday to reduce its reliance on federal aid. The moves are likely to presage a wider effort to repay the many billions of bailout dollars that propped up the bank during the worst of the financial crisis.\n\nBut the upbeat news came as Bank of America's troubled takeover of Merrill Lynch -- a watershed moment of the financial crisis -- continued to reverberate through Washington and Wall Street. Bank of America on Monday defied a request by Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, to divulge more details about the star-crossed acquisition. Few expect the controversy to end there.\n\nDespite the uproar over the Merrill deal, Bank of America and its leader, Kenneth D. Lewis, are moving quickly disentangle the bank from the federal bailout program. The bank said that it would pay the government $425 million for unused federal guarantees against losses at Merrill.\n\nBank of America is also working to convince federal regulators that it is sound enough to repay billions in federal aid, according to people familiar with the bank's plans. And on Monday, the bank named a new director to its board as part of a continuing effort to break with its troubled past. The director, Charles O. Holliday Jr., is the sixth new member to join the 15-person board since the summer.\n\nAnalysts characterized it as a day of progress for Bank of America, despite the nagging troubles over Merrill.\n\n''What the bank is trying to show is that it's come back to health and that it's operated solely as a private entity in the marketplace,'' said Richard X. Bove, a banking analyst at Rochdale Securities. ''But the bank is still under this enormous political pressure from Congress, the S.E.C. and the attorney general of New York.''\n\nA Bank of America spokesman said the bank's next step would be to start repaying $45 billion in federal bailout money. If regulators approve, the bank hopes to pay back at least $20 billion within months.\n\nThe bank announced its exit from two government programs on Monday. In addition to the Merrill guarantees, under which the government would have absorbed some of the losses on the brokerage company's assets, Bank of America also said it had exited a program run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that provided government backing for the bank's own debt. Those two moves came after five other steps the bank said it had taken to ''reduce its reliance on government support and return to normal market funding,'' the bank said.\n\n''We are a stronger company than we were even a few months ago,'' Mr. Lewis, the chief executive, said in a statement. ''We believe we have all the pieces in place to emerge from this current economic crisis as one of the leading financial services firms in the world.''\n\nMr. Lewis has also been trying to smooth relations with regulators. He met with Timothy F. Geithner, the secretary of the Treasury, in recent weeks and has put in place a succession plan in response to regulators' concern that the bank had not thought through who would take over when he eventually leaves.\n\nMany stock market investors attach little stigma to the bailouts, said Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays Capital. Indeed, the shares of banks that have accepted money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program are actually trading better in some cases than those that have returned it, he said.\n\n''TARP doesn't make you a bad company,'' Mr. Goldberg said. ''At the moment, it doesn't appear to bother the market.''\n\nBut the Merrill deal is still dogging Bank of America and Mr. Lewis. Since the bank acquired Merrill Lynch, Bank of America's management has come under intense scrutiny over information it had given to shareholders. The pressures grew last week when the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform demanded that the bank give up its right to keep private some of its legal documents related to the merger. "}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "It was, from the start, a delicate dance \u00d1 a minuet in the measure of money and politics.\n\nFor months, in the basement of the Treasury Department, Washington\u00d5s pay masters pushed one way, and the seven beleaguered giants of the bailout era pushed the other.\n\nIn the end, Kenneth R. Feinberg, the Obama administration\u00d5s special master of compensation, reduced the pay of the companies\u00d5 top earners.\n\nBut his ruling, which came to light Wednesday, will not bring an end to big paydays at the companies. Indeed, despite the remarkable government intrusion into these private enterprises, senior executives at some of the companies will enjoy multimillion-dollar pay packages this year, mostly in the form of stock. Other employees will earn even more.\n\nInterviews with officials, consultants and corporate executives involved in pay review suggest that the companies themselves \u00d1 the American International Group, Bank of America, Citigroup, Chrysler, General Motors, and the two car companies\u00d5 finance affiliates, GMAC and Chrysler Financial \u00d1 played a central role in the process and its outcome.\n\nBoth camps recognized from the beginning that bailout politics, as much as economics, would shape the final decision, according to people involved in the process. The popular resentment directed at companies that have received billions of taxpayer dollars \u00d1 and at Washington for providing the bailouts \u00d1 was never far from participants\u00d5 minds, these people said.\n\nIn a meeting with A.I.G. executives, for instance, representatives of the insurance giant suggested that the head of one of its business units receive pay on par with an industry chief executive.\n\n\u00d2Tell me how I justify that?\u00d3 asked Mary Pat Fox, a consultant working on Mr. Feinberg\u00d5s team. The room fell silent.\n\nMr. Feinberg declined to discuss the review, which began this summer, with a series of meetings with the companies\u00d5 executives. Each company provided its own list of the 25 most highly paid workers in 2008.\n\nIn the months that followed, the executives argued time and again that slashing pay would drive away talented employees, the very workers they needed to help turn their companies around. At times, the basement war room grew so crowded that meetings spilled into the office of Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who is now a prominent economic adviser to the Obama administration.\n\nA.I.G. refused to cancel some pay contracts that fell outside Mr. Feinberg\u00d5s purview. At one point, A.I.G. executives expressed frustration with the contracts. A.I.G., they said, was having trouble identifying just who its most highly paid employees were.\n\nBank of America, for its part, sent its head of trading and investment banking, Thomas K. Montag, to argue on his team\u00d5s behalf.\n\nBut some concessions were inevitable. Citigroup, for instance, sold its commodities trading unit, Phibro, to avoid a confrontation with Mr. Feinberg over a $100 million payday for Phibro\u00d5s star moneymaker, Andrew J. Hall.\n\nOthers dug in. Chrysler Financial executives initially asked to be freed from the review since the company had repaid its bailout money. But Chrysler Financial\u00d5s holding company owed the Treasury money, so the request was refused.\n\nOne surprise from A.I.G. came in a disclosure for an executive in the category of \u00d2other compensation.\u00d3 The total in that category for 2008 was $1.5 million, reflecting flights on the company\u00d5s corporate jet.\n\nBy late July, the pay team, in consultation with two prominent compensation experts, Lucian A. Bebchuk and Kevin J. Murphy, devised a 20-page document laying out Mr. Feinberg\u00d5s demands for information.\n\nThe companies were ordered to turn over minutes from their board\u00d5s compensation committee meetings over the past year, the stock awards for top executives during the last two years, and any performance measures that were used to determine compensation in the last two years.\n\nMr. Feinberg\u00d5s most controversial demand was that the companies disclose how much stock each of the top 25 executives held. Typically, only the top five make such disclosures in securities filings.\n\nThe pay team immediately received phone calls from the companies\u00d5 compensation managers, who called the request overly broad. But by mid-August, the companies complied.\n\nMichael Murray, who heads compensation at Citigroup, was the most upset. He told the pay team it was awkward for him to go to each of the executives and ask how much stock they held because many considered the question of whether they had sold shares over the years a personal matter.\n\nBank of America was particularly concerned that it might lose employees if Mr. Feinberg restricted pay. The bank was in the midst of integrating its operations with those of Merrill Lynch, which it agreed at the height of the crisis last year to buy.\n\nWhen Bank of America submitted the names of top executives to Mr. Feinberg, its representatives pointed out that 45 of the top 100 employees at the bank and Merrill had left.

E. Shaw thought,\u00d3 he said.\n\nMr. Summers and Shaw executives say his role there was to be a sounding board for Shaw\u00d5s traders. But interviews with friends and former colleagues suggest that Mr. Summers\u00d5s role at D. E. Shaw was wider and more complex.\n\nMr. Summers, these people say, was a marquee hire, a prized spokesman for Shaw. He routinely made himself available for private consultations with Shaw\u00d5s clients, an attractive perk for investing with the firm, as one client put it.\n\nMr. Summers, who taught economics and public policy at Harvard while advising Shaw, also met with investors in the United States, as well as in the cash-rich Middle East and Asia. He spoke at industry conferences, mixing with officials from public pension funds, endowments and other large institutions with many billions of dollars to invest.\n\nWhile at Shaw, Mr. Summers also peered into the inner workings of the $2 trillion hedge fund industry, which the Obama administration is now relying on to buy billions of dollars of worrisome assets from the nation\u00d5s beleaguered banks.\n\nSome of his critics worry that such ties raise questions about whether the government\u00d5s ever-changing effort to bolster the financial industry will benefit Wall Street in general, and hedge funds in particular, at the expense of taxpayers.\n\n\u00d2This is what might be called contamination,\u00d3 said Andrew Sabl, an associate professor of public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u00d2Did Summers spend so much time with the hedge fund, or its investors, sovereign wealth funds and so on, that he started to think like them?\u00d3\n\nMr. Summers joined the hedge fund world after his tempestuous, five-year term as the president of Harvard came to an unhappy end in February 2006, after a statement he made that women might lack an intrinsic aptitude for math and science.\n\nIt was at that time, to the surprise of some colleagues, that Mr. Summers seriously contemplated his options on Wall Street in part because he believed his chances to return to a prominent position in Washington had dimmed, friends say.\n\nAlthough he once compared finance to ketchup sales, Mr. Summers discussed job possibilities with Goldman Sachs, long considered the premier Wall Street bank, and with Citigroup, where Robert E. Rubin, Mr. Summers\u00d5s predecessor as Treasury secretary, had become a senior adviser.\n\nThen a young Harvard graduate named Julius Gaudio, whom Mr. Summers had met at alumni events, raised another possibility: D. E. Shaw, where Mr. Gaudio is a managing director. As part of Shaw\u00d5s rigorous screening process \u00d1 the firm accepts perhaps one out of every 500 applicants \u00d1 Mr. Summers was asked to solve math puzzles. He passed, and the job was his.\n\nIn a rare interview, David E. Shaw, who founded the firm in 1988 above a communist book shop in Greenwich Village, put it simply: Mr. Summers is \u00d2a brilliant, brilliant guy.\u00d3 That is from a former computer science professor at Columbia who now spends his time researching areas like treatments for cancer, while others run his hedge fund day-to-day.\n\nD. E. Shaw does not like to talk about what goes on inside its modish headquarters near Times Square. There, esoteric trading strategies are imagined, sketched on whiteboards and modeled on supercomputers by an elite corps of math wizards and scientists, most of them unknown to the outside world. "}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": " Even as Washington tries to rein in Wall Street pay, bankers are likely to make unusually large gains on the stock grants and options they received after shares in their companies fell sharply during the financial meltdown.\n\nBanks cut bonuses last year and shifted more pay into stock and options from cash, a tactic that lawmakers supported for its emphasis on long-term performance. Within months, the financial system began to mend -- partly with the help of billions of dollars in government aid -- and that stock began surging in value. Some of it can be cashed in starting in just a few months.\n\nAnd so the bonuses Wall Street received last year, billed as paltry at the time, are turning out to be among the most lucrative payouts ever.\n\nGoldman Sachs, for instance, sharply cut nearly all bonuses it paid last year but gave some executives more options than usual.\n\nThe company gave its general counsel, for example, 104,868 stock options and 14,117 shares in December, when the bank's stock was around $78.\n\nNow the bank's shares have more than doubled in value, making that stock and option award worth nearly $12 million, according to Equilar, an executive compensation research firm in Redwood Shores, Calif.\n\nThat executive is just one of many Wall Street workers who have seen the bonuses they received last year soar in value, even though some of the shares cannot be sold for a few years.\n\nGoldman's bonus pool last year was $4.82 billion, according to the New York attorney general's office, but because about half of that was paid in stock, it is now worth upwards of $7.8 billion. At JPMorgan Chase, workers have seen the value of the stock awarded them last year increase at least $3 billion.\n\n''People have to look at the sizable gains that have been made since stock and options were granted last year, and the fact is this was, in many ways, a windfall,'' said Jesse M. Brill, the chairman of CompensationStandards.com, a trade publication. ''This had nothing to do with people's performance. These were granted at market lows.''\n\nWall Street has long used a mix of stock and cash for bonuses. But the greater emphasis on cash before the financial crisis began meant executives could walk away rich even as their companies collapsed.\n\nThat has left many on Wall Street -- and in Washington -- demanding that a greater portion of pay be made in stock in hopes of rewarding long-term performance rather than short-term bets.\n\nThe Treasury's special master of pay, Kenneth R. Feinberg, has said there is ''too much reliance on cash'' on Wall Street and has proposed stock as an alternative.\n\nBanks began the trend by paying more in stock last year. Then, in February, Congress required that bonuses at bailed-out banks be paid entirely in stock. Last month, the Treasury Department took the idea further by proposing that some executives' salaries be paid in stock. The result is that Wall Street workers have more of their pay at risk than ever.\n\nStill, some compensation experts say the risk has been decreased by the government's backing of the financial system and historically low stock prices. After all, they point out, companies like JPMorgan, American Express and Capital One issued stock and options last year when their share prices had little chance of going anywhere but up.\n\nThe stock gains raise questions about the wisdom of pushing pay too far in either direction, favoring either cash or stock. Normal theories about stock compensation and risk-taking may not hold true today, compensation experts say, in large part because of the government's continued financial support of the industry.\n\nAnd they say the upside at many banks is far bigger than the downside, particularly for banks like Bank of America and Citigroup that have not yet seen their shares recover.

Along the way, hedge funds \u00d1 once so few in number that they represented a boutique industry populated by a rarefied group of specialists \u00d1 sprang up like kudzu.\n\nToday, there are around 10,000 hedge funds, compared with around 3,000 a decade ago and just a few hundred two decades ago.\n\nLittle other than money unites hedge funds, which invest in areas as varied as bonds, aircraft and small-business loans. They even make bets on the weather.\n\nWhat they have in common are lucrative fees: managers typically charge 20 percent of profits and 2 percent of total funds under management \u00d1 the latter of which they earn regardless of performance.\n\nThe wealth and power of hedge funds, and those handsome fees, were predicated on what now sounds like a hollow promise: to make money year in and year out.\n\nBut the years of easy money are over.\n\nBanks, pinioned by their own enormous mistakes and the economic slump, have cut back on hedge fund lending \u00d1 essentially turning off a financial spigot that the funds relied upon to goose their returns.\n\nEconomic uncertainty makes it harder to predict market movements. And investors, burned by big losses in 2008, are either questioning hedge fund fees or simply avoiding putting more money into the funds.\n\nThe regulatory vise, meanwhile, is tightening around an industry that long enjoyed the freedom to trade and operate without the constraints imposed on more traditional firms.\n\nOn Thursday, Mary L. Schapiro, Barack Obama\u00d5s nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, said during a confirmation hearing that she plans to more tightly regulate hedge funds as part of an effort to \u00d2bring transparency and accountability to all corners of the marketplace.\u00d3\n\nLawmakers are already considering new taxes and regulations that would require hedge funds to disclose more information about their secretive trading strategies.\n\nAdd it all up, and managing a hedge fund looks much less attractive than it used to.\n\n\u00d2The magnitude of this current crisis and its effect on their business was a real shock for hedge fund managers,\u00d3 said William N. Goetzmann, a professor who studies hedge funds at the Yale School of Management. \u00d2It will be a long-lasting effect because it\u00d5s caused customers to question the basic model.\u00d3\n\nMr. Griffin, fiercely competitive, says he is firmly in the camp of those trying to stay open. But he acknowledges that for several years, he will be working mostly for \u00d2psychic income.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "They work for General Motors but pull down Wall Street-style bonuses \u00d1 and that is raising some eyebrows in Washington.\n\nA group of employees in G.M.\u00d5s investment management division in New York, where top earners make $2 million to $3 million a year, are coming under sharp scrutiny by the Obama administration\u00d5s pay czar, Kenneth Feinberg.\n\nThe division, Promark Global Advisors, includes some of G.M.\u00d5s most highly paid employees and will figure prominently in Mr. Feinberg\u00d5s review of compensation at the automaker. G.M. and six other companies that have received substantial federal aid are due to submit compensation plans to the Treasury Department on Friday.\n\n\u00d2The pay czar will look at these financial people inside G.M. very similar to the people at the banks,\u00d3 said Alan M. Levine, a partner in the executive compensation and employment benefit practice at Morrison Cohen, a law firm in New York. \u00d2But he\u00d5s got to understand that the company needs to remain competitive and retain talent.\u00d3\n\nWhile pay at Promark pales next to that of top earners on Wall Street, as well at GMAC, the auto finance company, it has nonetheless become a focus of attention as Mr. Feinberg prepares to review G.M.\u00d5s pay plans.\n\nPromark oversees $102 billion of pension money for G.M. and its affiliates, but its traders and money managers also invest $18 billion on behalf of other institutions.\n\nThis summer, Mr. Feinberg reviewed lists of the top earners at several bailed-out companies, including General Motors. The traders at Promark accounted for many of the top 25 earners at the company, according to two people familiar with the carmaker\u00d5s situation. In particular, the Promark traders made more money last year than other G.M. executives because the traders\u00d5 pay was not based heavily on G.M.\u00d5s stock price.\n\nInstead, Promark bonuses are based mostly on each worker\u00d5s own performance and that of the overall investment fund, according to three people familiar with their pay structure.\n\nThe formula may present a problem because Mr. Feinberg could view the pension traders as similar to the proprietary traders at banks. The Treasury\u00d5s pay restrictions exempt company workers who earn their pay based on commissions, but to qualify, a worker must manage money for outside clients.\n\nIn a sense, G.M.\u00d5s pension is similar to the bank capital proprietary traders use to make bets, and proprietary traders are being required to follow the rules.\n\nBut some people might argue that keeping talent at G.M.\u00d5s pension fund calls for an exception.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s always been one of the top run pensions,\u00d3 said Steve Niss, managing director of RWD Executive Search. \u00d2They have some really talented people.\u00d3\n\nThe bonus scrutiny comes at a difficult moment for the pension unit, which changed its name from General Motors Asset Management to Promark this spring. The association with G.M. has made some of the unit\u00d5s clients and workers weary, according to two recruiters who said they have received inquiries from a number of Promark\u00d5s employees.\n\n\u00d2There\u00d5s no question if the compensation gets cut, they will leave,\u00d3 said Gustavo G. Dolfino, president of the WhiteRock Group, a recruiting firm in New York. \u00d2A number of them have already approached me since we entered this new era of socialist America.\u00d3\n\nG.M. is generally considered to have a well-run pension, and Promark\u00d5s leaders are credited for moving out of some stocks into bonds before the market downturn last year. The pension fund was down 11 percent, according to a G.M. spokeswoman, and that return looks golden compared with the pain at many investment firms.\n\nPromark is led by Nancy C. Everett, who was previously the chief investment officer for the Virginia Retirement System. Other senior managers previously worked at places like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and the Bank of New York Mellon.\n\n\u00d2They\u00d5re investment people, so the appropriate comparison is not our auto people in Detroit,\u00d3 said the spokeswoman, Julie Gibson. \u00d2It\u00d5s with investment people in New York.\u00d3\n\nMs. Gibson declined to confirm details about G.M.\u00d5s compensation filing.\n\nIt has never been clear how much money the unit makes, because Promark\u00d5s results are not broken out in the automaker\u00d5s financial filings. Last year as the company ran into trouble, some analysts suggested that Promark should be sold off, estimating its worth at a few billion dollars.\n\nPart of the unit\u00d5s value is its business managing money for outside pension funds. In recent years, G.M. set up separate legal structures so that the money managers could co-mingle G.M.\u00d5s pension money with outside funds. Xerox was among the companies that hired the unit, and the added scale was meant to defray G.M.\u00d5s pension costs. The pension unit also registered a multistrategy hedge fund."}

Feinberg, the government\u00d5s special master for compensation, has spent nearly five months studying pay packages at some of the nation\u00d5s largest banks. But ask him if bankers and traders earn far too much money, and he demurs.\n\n\u00d2I wouldn\u00d5t begin to say how much money you should make on Wall Street,\u00d3 Mr. Feinberg said in an interview last week, as he prepared to slash pay for the top 25 earners at seven firms that received significant government aid. \u00d2I\u00d5ve never worked on Wall Street. I don\u00d5t claim to know the ethos of Wall Street.\u00d3\n\nFor Mr. Feinberg, the process of cutting pay underscored the widening divide between Wall Street and the rest of America, where even a fraction of a banker\u00d5s pay seems like riches to many people.\n\n\u00d2A Wall Street executive will say to me: \u00d4Mr. Feinberg, last year I made $30 million. This year, you\u00d5re whacking me down, you\u00d5re reducing me to $10 million. How can you do that?\u00d5 \u00d3 Mr. Feinberg said. \u00d2On the other side of the argument, you hear people say \u00d4$10 million \u00d1 that\u00d5s outrageous.\u00d5 \u00d3\n\nPay experts said the plan, which emerged Wednesday, could lead to the departure of the very executives needed to return the firms to health, a prerequisite to repaying taxpayer support. Bankers regaled Mr. Feinberg with similar concerns in the months it took to prepare his order, but he said he thought they would be left with enough pay to persuade them to remain in their jobs.\n\n\u00d2If any one of these people left, I would be very disappointed,\u00d3 he said.\n\nMr. Feinberg waded through tens of thousands of documents and spoke with scores of executives, consultants and officials who wound up influencing the shape of the rules.\n\nHe also received e-mail messages from the public, some of whom urged him not to be too hard on Wall Street because of the financial stake now held by taxpayers.\n\nHe recounted an e-mail message he received recently about his decision to ask Kenneth D. Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America, to give up his salary this year.\n\nThe author argued that \u00d2a man is innocent until proven guilty,\u00d3 Mr. Feinberg recalled, and said it was unfair to punish Mr. Lewis for the ill-fated merger he forged with Merrill Lynch unless accusations by regulators over the bank\u00d5s failure to disclose Merrill losses and bonuses turn out to be true.\n\nMr. Feinberg said his mandate was to persuade executives at bailed-out companies like Bank of America to stay despite looming pay cuts. But since Mr. Lewis had already announced his retirement, there was no persuading to be done, he said.\n\nMr. Feinberg added that he was considering asking Mr. Lewis to voluntarily renegotiate more than $50 million in pension benefits that he will walk away with at the end of the year.\n\nMuch of Mr. Feinberg\u00d5s job also involved figuring out when an eye-popping salary signaled that a company was taking too much risk to reel in profits.\n\nIn one case, a trader at Citigroup, Andrew Hall, had a $100 million guaranteed contract that could not be altered without the trader\u00d5s permission. Citigroup sold Mr. Hall\u00d5s unit, called Phibro, before Mr. Feinberg could make a ruling.\n\nStill, Mr. Feinberg said he had already \u00d2concluded that anybody making $100 million a year is engaged in excessive risk.\u00d3\n\nTo the critics who wrote in to say the government should not be involved in private pay packages, Mr. Feinberg said he agreed \u00d1 in principle.\n\n\u00d2The capitalist system is a great system. Maybe people on Wall Street earn those multiple millions,\u00d3 he said.\n\n\u00d2But this is a rather unique situation where the government is a creditor and the government should be able to influence executive compensation,\u00d3 he said.\n\nMr. Feinberg said he expected his ruling to please no one. If that happened, he added, he would consider it a mark of success.\n\n\u00d2The populists will undoubtedly say:, \u00d4You caved. You gave Wall Street financiers too much money,\u00d5 \u00d3 he said. \u00d2The other side, the Wall Street culture, will say I put those companies at a disadvantage.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "A federal judge told the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday to give a better explanation of why it had agreed to a settlement with Bank of America over bonus disclosures without pressing the bank\u00d5s executives harder.\n\nJudge Jed S. Rakoff posed questions about the marriage of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.\n\nThe order, by Judge Jed S. Rakoff, came a day after the agency revealed that lawyers advised Bank of America\u00d5s executives not to disclose in a shareholder proxy billions of dollars in bonuses paid by Merrill Lynch just before the two merged.\n\nThis month the judge asked the two sides to say who at the bank had made the decision not to disclose Merrill\u00d5s planned bonuses just ahead of a shareholder vote on the merger.\n\nBoth responded in a filing Monday by citing lawyers for the bank, although Bank of America did not name the executives who had approved the lawyers\u00d5 decisions. The S.E.C. said it had not pressed the issue further because the bank wanted its communications with its lawyers to remain private under attorney-client privilege. And without such information, the S.E.C. could not consider charges against individuals at the bank.\n\nResponding swiftly, the judge questioned why the S.E.C. did not insist that Bank of America waive attorney-client privilege before striking a $33 million settlement. He also questioned whether bank executives \u00d1 or the outside lawyers \u00d1 should be charged in the case.\n\n\u00d2If the company does not waive the privilege,\u00d3 the judge wrote in his order, \u00d2the culpability of both the corporate officer and the company counsel will remain beyond scrutiny. This seems so at war with common sense.\u00d3 The judge added that the filings Monday by the S.E.C. and Bank of America raised more questions than they answered, and set a deadline of Sept. 9 for both parties to come back with fuller explanations of who should be held accountable for the bonus disclosure decision.\n\n\u00d2It is extremely unusual for a judge to want to look under the bonnet,\u00d3 said George B. Newhouse Jr., a former prosecutor and now a partner at Brown, White & Newhouse, a law firm in Los Angeles. \u00d2Implicitly, the judge is questioning whether the S.E.C. have given away the farm.\u00d3\n\nThe bank may have already effectively waived its ability to protect its lawyers by testifying about their role to the S.E.C., Mr. Newhouse added.\n\nThe case centers on $3.6 billion bonuses that were paid out by Merrill Lynch late last year, just before that firm was merged with Bank of America. Neither company disclosed the bonuses to shareholders, and the S.E.C. has charged that the companies\u00d5 proxy statement about the merger were misleading in their description of the bonuses.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, a Bank of America spokesman said the bonuses would not have had a big effect on the shareholder vote.\n\n\u00d2We presented to shareholders the strategic logic of the Bank of America and Merrill Lynch combination and we believe that is what shareholders were voting for,\u00d3 said Lawrence Di Rita, the spokesman.\n\nBank of America settled the S.E.C.\u00d5s allegations this month for a fine. Judge Rakoff, who works in the Southern District of New York, was assigned to decide whether to approve the settlement and has taken the unusual step of raising questions about it.\n\nAfter the S.E.C. and the bank reply in two weeks, the judge will decide whether to hold a second hearing. Ultimately, the judge will decide whether to reject the settlement, and if he does, that will send the S.E.C. back to the bargaining table with the bank.

{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "FOR Steve Feinberg, the onetime owner of Chrysler, the past year has been a crawl toward defeat. He lost billions of dollars. He lost prestige. He lost his privacy. And he ended up a ward and supplicant of the federal government.\n\nBut, even now, Mr. Feinberg, a man who can play a decent game of chess while blindfolded, is hard-pressed to pinpoint many mistakes. Sitting in his office on Park Avenue, far away from the detritus that surrounds Detroit, he grows pensive when asked what he has learned from his audacious \u00d1 and failed \u00d1 effort to privatize and resurrect the legendary and deeply troubled auto giant. \u00d2I don\u00d5t know what we could have done differently,\u00d3 he says, crossing his arms on his chest. \u00d2From the day we bought it, we worked hard to improve it.\u00d3\n\nHe pauses, pondering, as the clock ticks away. Then he shakes his head. \u00d2We were too optimistic on timing,\u00d3 he says. \u00d2Maybe what we should have done was not bought it.\u00d3\n\nMr. Feinberg took over Chrysler almost exactly two years ago, promising to revive the company. Chrysler filed for bankruptcy protection at the end of April. So how he and his private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management, choose to describe their journey with Chrysler is a delicate matter.\n\nIf he says he should have shelled out more money to help Chrysler, he could face the ire of investors who have already suffered heavy losses on his gambit. If he says he should have simply dumped Chrysler\u00d5s auto arm, while clinging to its more promising finance unit, he could be accused of caring more about his wallet than he did about Chrysler\u00d5s workers and the automaker\u00d5s role in the economy.\n\nMr. Feinberg\u00d5s education at the hands of Chrysler, the government and economic reality is emblematic of the limits private equity players have encountered as they\u00d5ve sought to reap outsize returns while also contending that they had the smarts and managerial prowess to repair companies of any size. Not too long ago, some pundits and analysts wondered whether private equity firms \u00d1 backed with a rising tide of easy bank loans \u00d1 could gain enough traction to make runs at seemingly untouchable behemoths like General Electric.\n\nWhen Cerberus began poking around Detroit, some at the firm said they thought that the American automobile industry was going to be the biggest turnaround story in history. In sessions with potential investors in the last few years, the Cerberus team came across as passionate, skilled and incredibly confident that they could succeed where others had failed.\n\n\u00d2I thought, wow, this really signals a real change in the landscape here,\u00d3 recalls a person who attended a Cerberus session who asked to remain anonymous because of agreements he signed. \u00d2I guess it gave me hope. The auto companies needed an enormous amount of capital, and where else was it going to come from?\u00d3\n\nJohn W. Snow, a former Treasury secretary in the Bush administration and Cerberus\u00d5s chairman, also heralded Cerberus as Chrysler\u00d5s savior, likening the firm\u00d5s investment to the government rescue of Chrysler in 1979.\n\n\u00d2Over 25 years ago, when Chrysler faced bankruptcy, it turned to the United States government for assistance,\u00d3 Mr. Snow said at a National Press Club meeting in 2007. \u00d2Today, Chrysler again faces new financial challenges. But it is private investment stepping in to inject much-needed support.\u00d3\n\nCerberus and its co-investors ultimately invested $7.4 billion in Chrysler, a sum now worth an estimated $1.4 billion. Ideally, Cerberus hoped to wed Chrysler\u00d5s finance arm to another finance company it controlled, GMAC. To that end, the risks in Chrysler\u00d5s auto business were something that the Cerberus team thought it could manage and that wouldn\u00d5t stand in the way of making billions of dollars for investors.\n\n\u00d2This will go down as one of the investments made at the very top of the credit bubble,\u00d3 Josh Lerner, a professor who studies private equity at the Harvard Business School. \u00d2They don\u00d5t look good. This will be a black eye on their record.\u00d3 Indeed, GMAC and Chrysler became so weak that they needed $22.6 billion in government aid in the last year to stay afloat. For Chrysler and its workers, investors, business partners and customers, was all of that worth it?\n\nMr. Feinberg defends his actions, saying he did everything possible to help the company. Known for avoiding publicity, he says that he was na\u0095ve not to anticipate the public attention that would surround him once he bought Chrysler and that he would have avoided the investment had he known.\n\n\u00d2I always view the press as something for guys who were trying to do big things,\u00d3 he says, perhaps overlooking that Chrysler was, indeed, a very big thing.\n\nDON JOHNSON, a former Chrysler employee, says he worked on initial production of the Jeep Liberty at a plant in Toledo, Ohio, in summer 2007, when Cerberus won the right to buy Chrysler from Daimler of Germany.\n\nTo the surprise of some, Mr. Feinberg managed to woo the support of the United Automobile Workers for the deal. But Mr. Johnson says he was always skeptical about the carmaker\u00d5s new owners. \u00d2Cerberus did not have a clue about the automotive industry,\u00d3 he says. \u00d2I don\u00d5t think anything could have been worse.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "Steven Rattner, one of the president\u00d5s leading advisers on the automotive industry, was an investor in the investment fund that controlled Chrysler and GMAC, according to financial disclosures released by the government.\n\nMr. Rattner joined the Treasury Department as a senior adviser in late February after a career as an investment banker that dated to the early 1980s. In that time, Mr. Rattner amassed a personal fortune in the hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the disclosures.\n\nThe disclosures, which are required of White House employees, covered only 2008 and the beginning of this year, but they listed Mr. Rattner\u00d5s earnings from various roles, including about $3 million for his role at his own investment firm and $250,000 for his role as a board member of IAC/InterActiveCorp, a media company.\n\nThe income allowed him to purchase a Fifth Avenue apartment, an airplane and a horse farm in North Salem, N.Y.\n\nMr. Rattner, 56, has led the automotive task force that has worked with Chrysler and General Motors to overhaul their businesses. He was personally involved in firing the chief executive of General Motors and negotiated with Chrysler\u00d5s creditors in an unsuccessful effort to avoid bankruptcy of that company.\n\nBut Mr. Rattner had a prior relationship with Cerberus Capital Management, an investment firm in New York that owned the majority of Chrysler and GMAC, the financing arm of General Motors. Mr. Rattner invested $500,000 to $1 million in a Cerberus fund that invested in auto parts companies. He also invested in an Asian fund run by Cerberus as well as Ableco Finance, a direct-lending business that is part of Cerberus.\n\nThe disclosure said that Mr. Rattner would divest any Cerberus holdings that presented a conflict, and a Treasury official confirmed that he had done so.\n\n\u00d2Like all employees, Steven Rattner was required to comply with financial conflict of interest rules, including divestitures where needed, and he has done so fully,\u00d3 said Jenni Engebretsen, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department.\n\nA spokesman for Cerberus declined to comment on Mr. Rattner\u00d5s relationship with Cerberus.\n\nCerberus was one of many investment firms that counted Mr. Rattner as an investor. But the investments of the other funds seemed by and large less tied to the auto industry that the funds run by Cerberus.\n\nMr. Rattner, who began his career as a journalist and worked at The New York Times until the early 1980s, had one other tie to Cerberus when he accepted the government post. An investment firm that he founded, the Quadrangle Group, owned a magazine company that was involved in a debt conflict with Cerberus. That company, Alpha Media, had borrowed money from Cerberus and late last year, it failed to meet its debt payments.\n\nQuadrangle was also involved in controversy last month when it was tied to a scandal involving the New York State pension fund.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York attorney general have accused some officials involved with the pension plan of accepting bribes from investment funds that wanted to manage money for the fund. Quadrangle was one investment firm mentioned in the complaint, although neither Mr. Rattner nor Quadrangle have been charged with wrongdoing."}

The vote, which ended Friday, was set off by Mr. Rattner\u00d5s departure in February, when he took the Treasury post.\n\nIt is a tense time for Quadrangle, a division of which manages the fortune of New York\u00d5s mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg. It is one of the most well-known firms now embroiled in an investigation by the New York attorney general into investments made by the New York State pension fund.\n\nMr. Rattner was personally involved in discussions with officials at several pension funds that had invested in Quadrangle. State and federal authorities contend that he hired a firm that had been run by Hank Morris, a now-indicted associate of New York\u00d5s former comptroller, to help gain business in New York.\n\nWhile the New York pension fund accounted for just 5 percent of the money in one of Quadrangle\u00d5s funds, the state\u00d5s prestige helped Mr. Rattner attract other big investors. Hiring placement advisers like Mr. Morris can be legal but can also raise ethical questions.\n\nIn addition, a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint related to the matter says that a company owned by one of Quadrangle\u00d5s funds agreed to a movie distribution deal that benefited a state official, David Loglisci, who has also been indicted.\n\nNeither Mr. Rattner nor Quadrangle has been charged with wrongdoing, but both remain under investigation.\n\nAt stake in the vote over Quadrangle\u00d5s future was the firm\u00d5s ability to use about $200 million for new investments. Private equity investors typically commit to finance investments in the future, but when an executive like Mr. Rattner departs, there are often clauses that allow them to try to back out.\n\nHad Quadrangle lost the vote, its fees could have been reduced sharply. A losing vote also would have signaled an erosion of investor confidence, which could have made it hard for the firm to raise more money.\n\nNew York City\u00d5s comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., said in a statement on Friday that three pension funds in the city would vote to cut off Quadrangle. But individual investors were not allowed to pull their money on their own. A majority of the fund\u00d5s investors, weighted by the size of their investment, had to vote against Quadrangle for any change to be made.\n\nOther pension investors in Quadrangle include Calpers, the big California pension fund; Calstrs, the state\u00d5s retirement fund for teachers; and New Jersey\u00d5s pension fund. It is not known how they voted.\n\nQuadrangle\u00d5s funds have suffered during the economic downturn but not as much as some other private equity funds. Mr. Rattner is still a substantial investor in the funds, though he is no longer involved in its operations. Mr. Rattner worked as a reporter for The New York Times before he went into investment banking in the 1980s. "}
{"klass": "louise_story", "text": "For Dow Kim, 2006 was a very good year. While his salary at Merrill Lynch was $350,000, his total compensation was 100 times that \u00d1 $35 million.\n\nThe difference between the two amounts was his bonus, a rich reward for the robust earnings made by the traders he oversaw in Merrill\u00d5s mortgage business.\n\nMr. Kim\u00d5s colleagues, not only at his level, but far down the ranks, also pocketed large paychecks. In all, Merrill handed out $5 billion to $6 billion in bonuses that year. A 20-something analyst with a base salary of $130,000 collected a bonus of $250,000. And a 30-something trader with a $180,000 salary got $5 million.\n\nBut Merrill\u00d5s record earnings in 2006 \u00d1 $7.5 billion \u00d1 turned out to be a mirage. The company has since lost three times that amount, largely because the mortgage investments that supposedly had powered some of those profits plunged in value.\n\nUnlike the earnings, however, the bonuses have not been reversed.\n\nAs regulators and shareholders sift through the rubble of the financial crisis, questions are being asked about what role lavish bonuses played in the debacle. Scrutiny over pay is intensifying as banks like Merrill prepare to dole out bonuses even after they have had to be propped up with billions of dollars of taxpayers\u00d5 money. While bonuses are expected to be half of what they were a year ago, some bankers could still collect millions of dollars.\n\nCritics say bonuses never should have been so big in the first place, because they were based on ephemeral earnings. These people contend that Wall Street\u00d5s pay structure, in which bonuses are based on short-term profits, encouraged employees to act like gamblers at a casino \u00d1 and let them collect their winnings while the roulette wheel was still spinning.\n\n\u00d2Compensation was flawed top to bottom,\u00d3 said Lucian A. Bebchuk, a professor at Harvard Law School and an expert on compensation. \u00d2The whole organization was responding to distorted incentives.\u00d3\n\nEven Wall Streeters concede they were dazzled by the money. To earn bigger bonuses, many traders ignored or played down the risks they took until their bonuses were paid. Their bosses often turned a blind eye because it was in their interest as well.\n\n\u00d2That\u00d5s a call that senior management or risk management should question, but of course their pay was tied to it too,\u00d3 said Brian Lin, a former mortgage trader at Merrill Lynch.\n\nThe highest-ranking executives at four firms have agreed under pressure to go without their bonuses, including John A. Thain, who initially wanted a bonus this year since he joined Merrill Lynch as chief executive after its ill-fated mortgage bets were made. And four former executives at one hard-hit bank, UBS of Switzerland, recently volunteered to return some of the bonuses they were paid before the financial crisis. But few think others on Wall Street will follow that lead.\n\nFor now, most banks are looking forward rather than backward. Morgan Stanley and UBS are attaching new strings to bonuses, allowing them to pull back part of workers\u00d5 payouts if they turn out to have been based on illusory profits. Those policies, had they been in place in recent years, might have clawed back hundreds of millions of dollars of compensation paid out in 2006 to employees at all levels, including senior executives who are still at those banks.\n\nA Bonus Bonanza\n\nFor Wall Street, much of this decade represented a new Gilded Age. Salaries were merely play money \u00d1 a pittance compared to bonuses. Bonus season became an annual celebration of the riches to be had in the markets. That was especially so in the New York area, where nearly $1 out of every $4 that companies paid employees last year went to someone in the financial industry. Bankers celebrated with five-figure dinners, vied to outspend each other at charity auctions and spent their newfound fortunes on new homes, cars and art.\n\nThe bonanza redefined success for an entire generation. Graduates of top universities sought their fortunes in banking, rather than in careers like medicine, engineering or teaching. Wall Street worked its rookies hard, but it held out the promise of rich rewards. In college dorms, tales of 30-year-olds pulling down $5 million a year were legion.\n\nWhile top executives received the biggest bonuses, what is striking is how many employees throughout the ranks took home large paychecks. On Wall Street, the first goal was to make \u00d2a buck\u00d3 \u00d1 a million dollars. More than 100 people in Merrill\u00d5s bond unit alone broke the million-dollar mark in 2006. Goldman Sachs paid more than $20 million apiece to more than 50 people that year, according to a person familiar with the matter. Goldman declined to comment.\n\nPay was tied to profit, and profit to the easy, borrowed money that could be invested in markets like mortgage securities. As the financial industry\u00d5s role in the economy grew, workers\u00d5 pay ballooned, leaping sixfold since 1975, nearly twice as much as the increase in pay for the average American worker.\n\n\u00d2The financial services industry was in a bubble,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u00d5s Economy.com. \u00d2The industry got a bigger share of the economic pie.\u00d3 "}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": "Reduce the growth of health care costs. Bend the curve. Find the game changers. Reform the delivery system.\n\nYawn.\n\nHealth care reform has always had two main goals. The first \u00d1 insuring the uninsured \u00d1 carries grand overtones of social justice. The second \u00d1 making the health care system more efficient \u00d1 can seem abstract, technocratic and a bit nerdy.\n\nJust listen to Rahm Emanuel, President Obama\u00d5s chief of staff. He recently dismissed critics who say the current bills don\u00d5t do enough to change health care by referring to them as \u00d2the executive board of the Brookings Institution\u00d3 and \u00d2people sitting in the shade at the Aspen Institute.\u00d3 The goal, Mr. Emanuel told my colleague Sheryl Gay Stolberg, is to pass a bill through Congress, not to figure out what the ideal bill may look like.\n\nCertainly, a bill that can\u00d5t pass Congress won\u00d5t help anyone. But I think it\u00d5s important to step back and understand precisely what health experts mean when they argue for reforming the delivery system.\n\nIt is not simply about bending the curve, or slowing the growth, of Medicare\u00d5s projected spending. It\u00d5s also about preventing thousands of needless deaths from hospital infections. It\u00d5s about making sure you get the best cancer treatment, even when that treatment is not the most profitable one. It\u00d5s about keeping health costs from denying most families a decent pay increase, as has happened in recent years.\n\nMaking the medical system more efficient is, in short, about saving lives and giving Americans a long overdue raise. It is arguably the single most important step that the federal government could take to improve people\u00d5s lives.\n\nAnd the bill that the House of Representatives passed last weekend simply does not get it done.\n\nThat is not a judgment based on some civics class ideal, either. The House bill falls far short when compared with a bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee last month. It also fails to live up to Mr. Obama\u00d5s campaign proposals and recent speeches. As Representative Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat, told me: \u00d2The president and the White House have been much better than Congress on these issues. The Congressional challenge is to live up to presidential rhetoric.\u00d3\n\nYou can argue, however, that these comparisons are actually reason for optimism \u00d1 that the very existence of the Senate Finance bill suggests that Congress still has a good chance to live up to the challenge.\n\nJonathan Gruber, an economist who helped devise the universal coverage plan in Massachusetts, says the Senate\u00d5s version of health reform does considerably more to control costs than he expected. A panel of experts led by Mark McClellan, a doctor and economist who used to run Medicare (and now happens to work at the Brookings Institution), concluded that the Senate Finance bill would help \u00d2slow long-term spending growth while building the high-value health care system our nation urgently needs.\u00d3 That panel also suggested some smart changes to the bill.\n\nAll along, Mr. Obama\u00d5s aides have said they knew that Congress might pass bills with serious flaws. The White House strategy was to stand back and work with Congressional leaders to fix those flaws once the legislation entered its endgame.\n\nThe endgame is here.\n\nFor anyone who cares about reducing medical costs and improving outcomes, there are probably six big issues to follow in the coming weeks. Let\u00d5s take them one at a time:\n\nTHE EASY STUFF Each year, about 100,000 people die from preventable infections they contract in a hospital. When 108 hospitals in Michigan instituted a simple process to prevent some of these infections, it nearly eliminated them.\n\nIf Medicare reduced payments for the treatment of such infections, it would give hospitals a huge financial incentive to prevent them. The Senate bill takes a small step in this direction by cutting payments to hospitals with high infection rates by 1 percent. The House bill merely requires hospitals to report their rates publicly. There are also other basic patient safety areas in which the bills can do much better.\n\nWHAT WORKS? Earlier this year, I used prostate cancer as an example of how our fee-for-service medical system leads to higher costs and worse outcomes. There are a handful of possible treatments for early-stage prostate cancer, and the fastest-growing are the most expensive. But no one knows which ones work best.\n\nModern medicine is full of such uncertainty. Again, the federal government could make a big difference here by giving Medicare a moderate amount of money for research, which would pay for itself many times over. The stimulus bill began paying for such research, but the health reform bills fail to pick up where the stimulus leaves off.\n\nA FED FOR HEALTH Twice a year, an outside advisory board sends Congress a list of suggestions for Medicare payment rates, based on the available evidence. Congress generally ignores them, in deference to the various industry groups that oppose any cuts to their payments.\n\nWe already have a wonderful model for how to avoid such interference. It\u00d5s called the Federal Reserve. The Fed is charged with setting interest rates based on economic conditions, not politics. The Senate bill would create such a commission for Medicare. Unfortunately, it initially applies to doctors and home health care providers but not hospitals, thanks to a deal between the hospitals and the White House. It expands to include everyone in 2019. The House bill has no such commission.\n\nWhether one ends up in the final bill will be a good test of Mr. Obama\u00d5s endgame leadership.\n\nTHE MCALLEN PROBLEM Both bills would create some promising voluntary programs meant to reward doctors and hospitals that provide good care rather than more care. But the doctors and hospitals providing the most expensive, wasteful care \u00d1 like those in McAllen, Tex., described by Dr. Atul Gawande in a recent New Yorker article \u00d1 surely will not sign up for these programs.\n\nAnd the language in the current bills suggests that Medicare officials cannot make the programs mandatory without new legislation from Congress, which is an invitation for lobbying from places like McAllen. Giving Medicare the authority to expand even a single successful program would be a big improvement.\n\nCHOICE Last week, the Democratic leaders in Congress sent out another e-mail message bragging that for people who didn\u00d5t like their insurance, health reform would provide \u00d2affordable choices for you that can\u00d5t be taken away.\u00d3 That isn\u00d5t true. The bills would do nothing to expand the choices of people with employer-provided insurance.\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, has been obsessively trying to change this \u00d1 to give even a small slice of people with the most expensive employer plans a chance to buy insurance on the exchange for small businesses and the uninsured. It\u00d5s not yet clear if he will succeed.\n\nTHE CADILLAC TAX Along with the Medicare commission, this tax is the biggest single difference between the Senate and House versions. Right now, health insurance \u00d1 unlike income \u00d1 is not taxed, effectively creating a subsidy for the costliest plans and health care providers. Labor leaders have helped persuade the House to keep the tax exclusion intact, largely because many of the most generous insurance plans are held by older unionized workers, who, in turn, have a lot of influence in their unions.\n\nBut the tax exclusion is terribly costly for the rest of us. If it were to disappear, employers would have an incentive to sign up for well-run insurance plans, leaving more money available for workers\u00d5 salaries. If the Senate\u00d5s tax on so-called Cadillac plans were enacted, the average household would be making an additional $1,000 every year (in today\u00d5s dollars) by 2019, according to an analysis of Congressional estimates by Mr. Gruber. In my house, $1,000 a year counts as real money.\n\nAre Congress and the White House likely to succeed on all six of these issues? Of course not. But if the final bill were just moderately better than the Senate Finance version, it would be a major victory. Even that Senate bill, as it is, would be worth celebrating. It has the potential to reduce cost growth significantly and to improve health \u00d1 in spite of all the recent criticism on those counts.\n\nAnd if the final bill ends up looking like the House bill? Well, then the criticism will have been far too tame."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " Slowing the growth of medical spending should, in principle, be one of the more popular parts of health reform. Health care already costs the typical household about $15,000 a year, and these costs are growing far more quickly than incomes. Yet when it comes time to turn principle into policy, the same problem always crops up.\n\nMost of that $15,000 is deducted from people\u00d5s paychecks, as taxes or insurance premiums, before they ever have a chance to spend it \u00d1 or to miss it. The health care they receive in exchange for the $15,000, however, is tangible. It\u00d5s a doctor\u00d5s visit, an X-ray or a surgical procedure that feels crucial to their well-being.\n\nSo we end up with a conundrum. We want health spending to slow, just not our own: My health care is a benefit; yours is a cost.\n\nThe A.F.L.-C.I.O. and its member unions have served up an excellent example of this contradiction over the last few weeks. They have been fighting to defeat the so-called Cadillac tax \u00d1 a tax on very generous, expensive health insurance plans. And they\u00d5ve been getting help from big business\u00d5s lobbyists, like the Chamber of Commerce, who tend to be hostile to any new tax. We\u00d5ll find out in coming days whether the proposal survives the Senate Finance Committee\u00d5s markup of its health bill.\n\nThe Cadillac tax has the potential to slow health costs significantly. But like every other idea to slow spending, it can also sound downright scary. Just think of the proposal to have the government pay for end-of-life counseling, which turned into a debate over \u00d2death panels.\u00d3\n\nThis means the Cadillac tax isn\u00d5t just important in its own right. It\u00d5s also a preview of a battle that we\u00d5ll be fighting for years.\n\nMedical costs really are rising at an unsustainable rate. If their current growth rate continues, they will bankrupt Medicare or require crushing tax increases. We need to find ways to cut back, and it can\u00d5t just be the other guy who\u00d5s affected.\n\nUnion leaders don\u00d5t even like the name Cadillac tax. They say, correctly, that the tax wouldn\u00d5t fall only on chief executives, investment bankers and the like. It would fall on some members of the middle class, especially unionized workers with generous health coverage.\n\nThe leading proposal in the Finance Committee would apply to family insurance plans that cost roughly $21,000 and up starting in 2013. For the sake of fairness, the threshold would vary based on geography and the average age of a company\u00d5s work force. In all, something like 10 percent of plans would be subject to the tax in 2013, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group.\n\nBut the number of affected plans would grow over time. The Senate has been talking about having the threshold rise each year by the inflation rate plus one percentage point. Since medical spending has been rising much faster than inflation, more and more plans would probably cross the threshold in the years after 2013. Over the next decade, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax would pay as much as 25 percent of the cost of extending coverage to the uninsured.\n\n\u00d2People are going to see this as a huge middle-class tax hit,\u00d3 argues Gerald Shea, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. official overseeing its health lobbying.\n\nInsurance companies \u00d1 technically the targets of the tax \u00d1 would pass on the cost to employers, and employers would presumably pass it on to workers. The cost of insurance could rise. Or perhaps more likely, companies would stop offering such generous plans.\n\nHere\u00d5s the big question, though: Would that be so bad?\n\nCurrently, the health insurance you get from your employer isn\u00d5t taxed, unlike almost all the rest of your compensation. So employers and workers have both fallen in love with generous plans. If an employer pays a worker an extra $100 in income, the worker may keep only $75 of it, while the government will get $25 in taxes. But if the employer puts that $100 toward health insurance, the worker will get all of it.\n\nThis tax break causes us to buy more health insurance than we would if the playing field for taxes were level, much as the tax breaks for housing helped inflate the real estate bubble. In effect, the tax-free treatment is a subsidy for health insurers, doctors and hospitals. It encourages wasteful spending \u00d1 the extra M.R.I., the brand-name drug that\u00d5s no better than a generic, the cardiac-stent procedure that has no evidence of extending life (but does have some risk).\n\nIf the Cadillac tax started to eat away at the this tax break, you could expect three things to happen.\n\nFirst, employees would shy away from the most expensive plans. The evidence is pretty clear on this: when workers bear some portion of the cost of insurance, their choices change.\n\nIn the 1990s, the University of California began charging its janitors, secretaries, professors and other employees a monthly fee for their health insurance plan \u00d1 unless they chose the least expensive one. Many switched out of the most expensive plans, often to save as little as $10 a month, notes the economist Thomas Buchmueller. The change also led insurers to compete harder for people\u00d5s business, improving the quality of the cheapest plans at the expense of the insurers\u00d5 profit margins.\n\nSecond, the most generous insurance plans really would become less generous, but the change would probably do nothing to harm people\u00d5s health. The distinguishing feature of these gold-plated plans tends to be their lack of co-payments. The $20,400 family plan that a typical New Hampshire state employee has, for instance, includes free M.R.I.\u00d5s, as The Boston Globe has reported. And when M.R.I.\u00d5s are free, people tend to get more of them than their well-being requires.\n\nThe most comprehensive study of health insurance, by the RAND Corporation, bears this out. People with Cadillac plans are no healthier than people with Chevy Malibu plans. (Similarly, Americans are no healthier than citizens of rich countries that spend far less on medical care.) \u00d2Taking someone who\u00d5s uninsured and giving them insurance unambiguously improves their health,\u00d3 says Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at M.I.T., \u00d2but taking someone who\u00d5s well-insured and making them really well-insured doesn\u00d5t make them any healthier.\u00d3\n\nFinally, we can expect that a Cadillac tax will, in the long run, increase workers\u00d5 incomes. The money companies spend on health insurance, after all, doesn\u00d5t come from nowhere. The more they spend on insurance, the less that\u00d5s available for wage increases. This is why wage increases are often meager when insurance premiums are growing quickly, as has been the case over the last seven years or so.\n\nWhen asked about the potential benefits of a Cadillac tax \u00d1 better wage growth and less wasteful medical spending, with no damage to health \u00d1 labor officials tend to dismiss them as the stuff of airy economic theory. But they\u00d5re not.\n\nThe slow wage growth and spiraling health costs of recent years are not theoretical. The fact that people with Cadillac plans aren\u00d5t healthier than people with merely good insurance isn\u00d5t theoretical. The difference between what this country spends on medicine and what other countries spend isn\u00d5t theoretical.\n\nThere is no question that a Cadillac tax would be somewhat unpleasant for people with Cadillac plans. It could increase their insurance costs or force them into less generous plans.\n\nBy opposing the tax, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is simply doing its job. It is defending the interests of its members who have such plans \u00d1 just as business groups are defending the interests of their members. That is what special interests do: look out for their own constituents, even at the expense of the national interest."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " Successful economic ideas usually end up being taken too far.\n\nDemocrats dominated the middle part of the 20th century, thanks in part to their vigorous response to the Great Depression. They used the government to soften the effects of the Depression and to build the modern safety net. But they failed to see the limits of the government's ability to manage the economy and helped usher in the stagflation of the 1970s.\n\nRonald Reagan then came to power promising to cut taxes and unleash the forces of the market. And the Democrats spent the next dozen years struggling to absorb the lessons of their failures.\n\nMore than a few people believe the Republican Party is in a similar place today.\n\nWhen I asked Dale Jorgenson, the eminent expert on productivity (and a Republican), what had been the positive aspects of President George W. Bush's economic policy, Mr. Jorgenson said, ''I don't see any redeeming features, unfortunately.'' After Republicans opposed the stimulus package this year, The Financial Times, not exactly a liberal organ, called the party's ideology harebrained. When Olympia Snowe was recently explaining why she might be the only Republican senator to vote for health reform, she suggested it was because her party had moved so far to the right.\n\nBut perhaps the most persistent -- and thought-provoking -- conservative critic of the party has been Bruce Bartlett. Mr. Bartlett has worked for Jack Kemp and Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush. He has been a fellow at the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation. He wants the estate tax to be reduced, and he thinks that President Obama should not have taken on health reform or climate change this year.\n\nAbove all, however, he thinks that the Republican Party no longer has a credible economic policy. It continues to advocate tax cuts even though the recent Bush tax cuts led to only mediocre economic growth and huge deficits. (Numbers from the Congressional Budget Officeshow that Mr. Bush's policies are responsible for far more of the projected deficits than Mr. Obama's.)\n\nOn the spending side, Republican leaders criticize Mr. Obama, yet offer no serious spending cuts of their own. Indeed, when the White House has proposed cuts -- to parts of Medicare, to an outdated fighter jet program and to subsidies for banks and agribusiness -- most Republicans have opposed them.\n\nHow, Mr. Bartlett asks, is this conservative? How is it in keeping with a party that once prided itself on fiscal responsibility -- the party of President Dwight Eisenhower (who refused to cut taxes because the budget wasn't balanced) or of the first President Bush (whose tax increase helped create the 1990s surpluses)?\n\n''So much of what passes for conservatism today is just pure partisan opposition,'' Mr. Bartlett says. ''It's not conservative at all.''\n\nHe became well known several years ago for attacking the younger Mr. Bush, in a book called ''Impostor.'' But Mr. Bartlett has turned out to be more interesting than most people who publicly break from their own party. In a series of columns for Forbes and in a book that comes out next week, ''The New American Economy,'' he has started to describe a new conservatism. He is, in effect, laying intellectual groundwork for a Republican Bill Clinton -- the politician who curbs his party's excesses.\n\nYou can argue that this sort of reassessment should not make conservatives feel insecure. In many ways, they have won. Mr. Obama, like Mr. Clinton, has proposed raising the top marginal tax rate to a level that's lower than it was for most of the Reagan administration. Most Democrats now acknowledge the central idea of supply-side economics: tax rates matter.\n\nThe best parts of supply-side economics have been ''completely integrated into mainstream economics,'' Mr. Bartlett writes. ''What remains is a caricature -- that there is no problem that more and bigger tax cuts won't solve.'' "}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": "The debate over medical malpractice can often seem theological. On one side are those conservatives and doctors who have no doubt that frivolous lawsuits and Democratic politicians beholden to trial lawyers are the reasons American health care is so expensive. On the other side are those liberals who see malpractice reform as another Republican conspiracy to shift attention from the real problem.\n\nYet most people, I suspect, still aren\u00d5t sure exactly what to think. For them, the good news is that the issue has inspired a lot of research by economists and others with no vested interest. And after sifting through years of data, these researchers have come to some basic factual conclusions.\n\nThe findings are especially useful now that President Obama is promising to finance malpractice reform pilot projects, and Republicans are urging him to go further. Here, then, is the brief version of the facts:\n\nThe direct costs of malpractice lawsuits \u00d1 jury awards, settlements and the like \u00d1 are such a minuscule part of health spending that they barely merit discussion, economists say. But that doesn\u00d5t mean the malpractice system is working.\n\nThe fear of lawsuits among doctors does seem to lead to a noticeable amount of wasteful treatment. Amitabh Chandra \u00d1 a Harvard economist whose research is cited by both the American Medical Association and the trial lawyers\u00d5 association \u00d1 says $60 billion a year, or about 3 percent of overall medical spending, is a reasonable upper-end estimate. If a new policy could eliminate close to that much waste without causing other problems, it would be a no-brainer.\n\nAt the same time, though, the current system appears to treat actual malpractice too lightly. Trials may get a lot of attention, but they are the exception. Far more common are errors that never lead to any action.\n\nAfter reviewing thousands of patient records, medical researchers have estimated that only 2 to 3 percent of cases of medical negligence lead to a malpractice claim. For every notorious error \u00d1 the teenager who died in North Carolina after being given the wrong blood type, the 39-year-old Massachusetts mother killed by a chemotherapy overdose, the newborn twins (children of the actor Dennis Quaid) given too much blood thinner \u00d1 there are dozens more. You never hear about these other cases.\n\nSo we have a malpractice system that, while not as bad as some critics suggest, is expensive in all the wrong ways.\n\nMedical errors happen more frequently here than in other rich countries, as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation recently found. Only a tiny share of victims receive compensation. Among those who do, the awards vary from the lavish to the minimal. And even though the system treats most victims poorly, notes Michelle Mello of the School of Public Health at Harvard, \u00d2the uncertainty leads to defensive behavior by physicians that generates more costs for everyone.\u00d3\n\nSomething else that\u00d5s expensive in all the wrong ways, of course, is the rest of the health care system. That\u00d5s no coincidence.\n\nIf you talk to doctors about malpractice, you come to realize that the root of their objections isn\u00d5t financial. Yes, the money matters, and, yes, there are horror stories about $200,000 premiums for malpractice insurance. But most premiums are nowhere near that high.\n\nAll told, jury awards, settlements and administrative costs \u00d1 which, by definition, are similar to the combined cost of insurance \u00d1 add up to less than $10 billion a year. This equals less than one-half of a percentage point of medical spending. There have been years when malpractice payouts rose sharply, but there have also been years when they did not. Over the last two decades, the amount has increased roughly in line with total medical spending, according to a study in the journal Health Affairs, based on a national database.\n\nThis being said, the malpractice system does affect the morale of doctors. It leaves them wondering when they will be publicly accused of doing the very thing they\u00d5ve sworn not to do: harm patients. Dr. S. Anthony Wolfe, the chief of plastic surgery at Miami Children\u00d5s Hospital, told me he had been to court three times in the last 34 years and won all three times. \u00d2But it was a Pyrrhic victory,\u00d3 he said. He spent weeks in court, enduring \u00d2rude, demeaning and endless depositions and badgering.\u00d3\n\nYou can understand why such experiences would lead doctors to order extra tests and treatments.\n\nPerhaps the best-known study of defensive medicine \u00d1 by Dr. Mark McClellan, who later ran Medicare in the Bush administration, and Daniel Kessler \u00d1 compared cardiology treatment in states that had capped malpractice awards in the 1980s and early \u00d590s with those that didn\u00d5t. In the states without caps, stenting and other treatments were more common, but the outcomes were no better.\n\nLater research \u00d1 into various surgical operations, for instance \u00d1 has found less of evidence of defensive medicine. But Mr. Chandra points out that this later work (including some of his own) is not as elegant as the cardiology paper. States have not made as many changes to malpractice law in recent years, which makes research tricky. That\u00d5s why Mr. Chandra\u00d5s estimate of the cost of defensive medicine, up to $60 billion a year, stems largely from the cardiology work.\n\nObviously, the precise amount of defensive medicine can never be known. Anyone who sets out to find a certain answer will be able to cite one study or another. (One good example of ideology dressed up as economics: the American Medical Association does not adjust for inflation when claiming that malpractice costs are soaring.)\n\nStill, the researchers in the field tend to agree about the scale of the problem \u00d1 and how much malpractice reform might accomplish.\n\nDr. McClellan puts it this way: \u00d2By itself, it\u00d5s not comprehensive solution. I do think it\u00d5s an important element.\u00d3 Katherine Baicker, another economist who served in the Bush administration, says, \u00d2reforming the malpractice system wouldn\u00d5t be a bad thing, but it wouldn\u00d5t solve the crisis of mounting health costs.\u00d3 Dana Goldman, director of the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy at the University of Southern California, adds: \u00d2It is one of the things we need to address if we want to bend the cost curve. But it\u00d5s not going to solve the problem.\u00d3\n\nThe problem is that just about every incentive in our medical system is to do more. Most patients have no idea how much their care costs. Doctors are generally paid more when they do more. And, indeed, extra tests and procedures can help protect them from lawsuits.\n\nSo the most promising fixes are the ones that don\u00d5t treat the malpractice system as an isolated issue.\n\nImagine if the government paid for more research into which treatments really do make people healthier \u00d1 a step many doctors don\u00d5t like. Such evidence-based medicine could then get the benefit of the doubt in court. The research would also make it easier to set up \u00d2health courts,\u00d3 with expedited case schedules and expert judges, which many doctors advocate.\n\nSimilarly, you would want to see more serious efforts to reduce medical error and tougher discipline for doctors who made repeated errors \u00d1 in exchange for a less confrontational, less costly process for those doctors who, like all of us, sometimes make mistakes.\n\nA grand compromise along these lines may be unlikely. But it\u00d5s a lot more consistent with the evidence than narrower ideas. The goal, remember, isn\u00d5t just to reduce malpractice lawsuits. It\u00d5s also to reduce malpractice."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": "What if in the end they got it right?\n\nWhat if, amid all their missteps and all the harsh criticism, the people in charge of battling the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression \u00d1 Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner, Lawrence Summers, Henry Paulson and the rest \u00d1 basically succeeded?\n\nIt is clearly too soon to know for sure. But the evidence is now pointing pretty strongly in one direction: history books may conclude that the financial crisis of 2008 turned out to be far less bad than it could have been and that Washington deserved much of the credit.\n\nThe Labor Department announced Friday that the economy lost fewer jobs in July than in any month since before Lehman Brothers collapsed last fall. Credit markets no longer look anything like they did after Lehman\u00d5s collapse and are in considerably better shape than just a few months ago. Stocks are up almost 50 percent from their March low. \u00d2It\u00d5s over,\u00d3 the economists at Barclays Capital declared Friday, referring to the Great Recession.\n\nThe news has been good enough that the Obama administration spent Friday trumpeting its record. More telling, however, is the fact that even Nouriel Roubini, the prophetically pessimistic economist who saw the crisis coming (and doesn\u00d5t think the recession has yet ended), is now praising policy makers. He recently urged that Mr. Bernanke be reappointed as Federal Reserve chairman, saying he helped avert a \u00d2near depression that seemed highly likely after the financial collapse last fall.\u00d3\n\nWashington\u00d5s early responses to the bubbles in real estate and stocks, and then to the crisis that followed, were full of mistakes. But since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the record has started to change. The government has undertaken one extraordinary effort after another to revive the economy, and the economy has seemed to respond.\n\nLast September, the Fed, the Bush administration and Congress pushed through an unpopular $700 billion bailout plan to keep other parts of the financial markets from collapsing. In subsequent months, the Fed \u00d1 the subject of much recent criticism from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress \u00d1 quickly propped up individual credit markets when they sagged.\n\nAnd the Obama administration, having failed in its early weeks to calm the financial markets, eventually managed to do just that. It pushed for a stimulus bill, over unanimous Republican opposition in the House, that is certainly imperfect but that has already saved more than 500,000 jobs, according to separate estimates by two prominent research firms, IHS Global Insight and Moody\u00d5s Economy.com. The White House also endured withering criticism from liberals who argued that credit markets would remain dysfunctional without a government takeover of banks.\n\n\u00d2Bernanke, Obama, Geithner and Summers were intelligent enough to know that the right-wing crowd was crazy to say, \u00d4Let the banks go bankrupt,\u00d5 and confident enough to ignore the left-wing \u00d4Nationalize the banks\u00d5 crowd,\u00d3 said Robert Barbera, a longtime economist and author of the recent \u00d2The Cost of Capitalism,\u00d3 which criticizes the Fed for allowing the housing bubble to grow so large. \u00d2I give them very high marks.\u00d3\n\nMany people, of course, would not be so charitable. And that\u00d5s understandable. The economy remains in very bad shape, and economists think the unemployment rate still has further to rise.\n\nMost confusing of all, no one can know how bad \u00d1 or how good \u00d1 the economy might have been if the government hadn\u00d5t pursued the aggressive policy it did. But there are certainly some clues.\n\nA central piece of the Obama administration\u00d5s and Fed\u00d5s joint financial strategy was the banking stress test. The results of those tests, which showed the system to be in better shape than many (including \u00d1 full disclosure \u00d1 me) believed, began to leak in early May. Immediately, credit markets started improving. The TED spread, a comparison of interest rates that measures market fears, fell 43 percent over the next three weeks and is even lower today.\n\nAs for the stimulus, economies in countries that enacted relatively large programs, like the United States, China and Australia, have survived fairly well this year, relative to forecasts. Countries that enacted smaller programs, like France, Italy and India, have not done as well, as Christina Romer, a top Obama adviser, pointed out this week.\n\nBut the best clue may be history. Washington did not respond proactively to the financial crisis of 1929, and the Great Depression ensued. Japan didn\u00d5t respond to its 1990s crisis with much force, and its economy languished.\n\nEven the past year makes the case. On Sept. 14, 2008, policy makers allowed Lehman to go under. Financial panic ensued. Indeed, one notable aspect of Washington\u00d5s recent successes is that they have been fashioned by the same people who helped aggravate the crisis.\n\nMr. Paulson, then the Treasury secretary, made the main call to let Lehman collapse, as David Wessel, economics editor of The Wall Street Journal, reports in his new book on the crisis. But within days, Mr. Paulson was on Capitol Hill arguing for the $700 billion bailout. Mr. Bernanke played down the housing bubble as a Bush administration adviser and at his 2005 confirmation hearing. Once the crisis began, he oversaw perhaps the most forceful policy response in the history of central banking.\n\nMr. Geithner may be the most fascinating character in the drama. As the president of the New York Fed, he failed to raise alarm about the Wall Street strategies that made the crisis possible. In his early weeks as the Obama Treasury secretary, his uneven performance led a few House Republicans to call for his resignation. In White House meetings, some advisers told Mr. Obama that they were worried the Geithner approach wasn\u00d5t aggressive enough.\n\nThat could still turn out to be the case: credit markets aren\u00d5t yet normal, and jobs are still disappearing every month. And some of the administration\u00d5s specific programs, like the public-private partnership to buy toxic bank assets, have fallen flat. But the sum total of the response has been to erase a pervasive sense of fear in the markets and to allow lending to resume.\n\nHaving done that, the White House and Fed face a new set of problems. Mr. Bernanke will have to decide how slowly to withdraw the Fed\u00d5s enormous interventions. Mr. Obama will have to sell Congress on an agenda that he has vowed will move the economy away from its boom-and-bust cycles. On every item of that agenda \u00d1 health care, energy, financial reregulation \u00d1 there are reasons to wonder whether Mr. Obama and Congress will end up with a bill that makes a big difference.\n\nJust look at the record. Washington may be in the process of proving that it can halt an economic crisis. But it utterly failed to keep that crisis from occurring."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " The one highly visible success of the stimulus program has been the cash-for-clunkers program. It induced a boom in vehicle sales this summer that clearly would not have happened otherwise.\n\nThe rest of the stimulus has created a lot of jobs \u00d1 700,000 to 1.5 million, according to economists\u00d5 estimates. But it has done so in thousands of little ways: scattered construction projects, plugged-up school budgets and the like. Politically, these measures are not popular enough to create a groundswell for more of them.\n\nAnd the economy still needs help. So White House officials are looking at creating a new version of cash for clunkers \u00d1 this time for home weatherization.\n\nJohn Doerr, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist, and former President Bill Clinton have separately suggested versions of the idea to the White House. Mr. Doerr calls his proposal, which would give households money to pay for weatherization projects, \u00d2cash for caulkers.\u00d3 Rahm Emanuel, President Obama\u00d5s chief of staff, told me, \u00d2It\u00d5s one of the top things he\u00d5s looking at.\u00d3\n\nThe idea has a lot to recommend it. The housing bust has idled contractors and construction workers, who could be put to work insulating homes and caulking air leaks. Many households, meanwhile, would save substantial money \u00d1 not to mention help the climate \u00d1 by weatherizing their homes, research by McKinsey & Company has shown. All in all, a cash-for-caulkers program seems like a promising part of the jobs program for 2010 that Mr. Obama has suggested he is planning.\n\nBut I would also mention one point of caution: the details of any caulkers plan will matter enormously. Weatherizing a home, as I recently discovered, turns out to be a lot more complicated than buying a car.\n\nThis year, my wife and I had an energy audit done on our home. We were interested in finding out if we could save money and, given the attention that weatherizing was starting to get, I figured it could also make for good column fodder. For $400, an auditor spent hours scouring our house, with the help of a big fan he set up in our front door and an infrared camera. He produced a full-color, 13-page detailed report, informing us of the leaks in our house, and he was also willing to tell us which changes were usually a waste of money (new windows).\n\nEven so, we are still trying to figure out which weatherization projects we should do. The whole package would probably cost $4,500 and save us something like $400 a year. We may not stay in the house nearly long enough to justify the investment.\n\nSuch concerns are typical. How do you find an auditor? How do you know whether you should seal a few ducts or pay $2,000 for new insulation? Which of the existing subsidies \u00d1 state and federal \u00d1 might you qualify for?\n\nMr. Doerr and Mr. Clinton are well aware of these problems. Mr. Clinton has sent the White House a memorandum written by his foundation staff that lays out the reasons people don\u00d5t weatherize their homes. Mr. Doerr, who sits on a board of outside economic advisers to Mr. Obama that is working on a formal cash-for-caulkers proposal, told me that his goal was to \u00d2keep it really simple so we can do it really fast.\u00d3\n\nThe Doerr plan would cost $23 billion over two years. Most of the money would go for incentive payments, generally $2,000 to $4,000, for weatherization projects. The homeowner would always have to pay at least 50 percent of the project\u00d5s total cost. About $3 billion would be set aside for retailers and contractors in the hope that they would promote the program, much as car dealerships promoted cash for clunkers. (Mr. Doerr says he owns no stake in any weatherization companies.)\n\nThe Clinton plan depends on the reallocation of clean energy money from the stimulus bill that has not yet been spent. It covers not just houses and apartments but also commercial and industrial buildings.\n\nPerhaps most intriguing is its proposal to help homeowners and building owners who are nervous they will end up selling their property before a weatherization project has paid for itself. Under the Clinton plan, they could add the project\u00d5s cost to their long-term property tax bill, effectively splitting the cost with the next owner. The New York State Legislature approved such a program on Monday.\n\nAll these efforts would lead to more weatherization. But I would be surprised if they were enough to create a program as successful as cash for clunkers. Remember: Many homeowners could already save money by weatherizing their homes. And they are not doing so.\n\nThat\u00d5s in large part because the projects can seem so daunting. To date, energy experts, in the government and the private sector, have not done a good job of distributing useful information. What does exist tends to be either too complicated or too general. I recently asked various experts what percentage of homes should get new insulation, for example, and several replied that it varied by region \u00d1 which is both true and unhelpful.\n\nImagine, though, if the Energy Department put together a weatherization-for-dummies fact sheet and Mr. Obama began promoting it.\n\nIt could start by noting that almost all homes should have a programmable thermostat (about $100) to turn down the heat or the air-conditioning when nobody is home. Other simple steps can include wrapping a water heater with an insulation blanket and replacing heating and cooling filters. Next on the list would be sealing easily accessible holes in air ducts, which can cost just a few hundred dollars and pay for itself in a few years. In California, the average duct system loses 30 percent of its heating or cooling to leaks.\n\nFinally would come the more complicated categories, including insulation and heating equipment. Yet some basic information could still help enormously here. What share, say, of Midwestern homes built before 1950 could use more attic insulation? How quickly would the insulation pay for itself on average? Every home is different, obviously. But without any reference point, many people won\u00d5t be confident enough to plunge into a project.\n\nThe shining example that Mr. Clinton cites is a Houston program in which the local government pays about $1,000 to weatherize any home in a given neighborhood. It works in part because the houses need similar improvements, which makes the program easy for residents to understand.\n\n\u00d2Unlike traditional programs that provide an audit and a customized package of solutions for each home,\u00d3 the Clinton memorandum notes, Houston \u00d2offers a fixed set of interventions that include climate-appropriate \u00d4low hanging fruit.\u00d5 \u00d3\n\nThe bottom line is that cash for caulkers would be trickier than cash for clunkers \u00d1 yet would have the potential to do far more good. McKinsey, the consulting firm, estimates that households could reduce their energy use by 28 percent over the next decade. In terms of greenhouse gases, that would be the equivalent of taking half of all vehicles in this country off the road.\n\nAnd unlike many other climate-friendly policies, it would not cost money over the long term. Done right, cash for caulkers would be precisely the kind of stimulus that makes the most sense: spending money now to save money later."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " Last winter, stories of companies cutting their workers\u00d5 pay were everywhere. FedEx said in December that it would reduce the pay of salaried workers by 5 percent. Caterpillar announced it would cut pay by up to 15 percent. The employees of a General Motors dealership near Philadelphia agreed to work one week for minimum wage.\n\nFor the first time since perhaps the Great Depression, it seemed possible that average hourly pay would actually begin falling, even before inflation was taken into account.\n\nBut that\u00d5s not what has happened.\n\nWage growth has picked up in the last several months, according to two different government surveys. You don\u00d5t hear or read nearly as many stories about pay cuts these days. Even though unemployment has reached its highest level in 26 years, most workers have received a raise over the last year.\n\nThat contrast highlights what I think is one of the more overlooked features of the Great Recession. In the job market, at least, the recession\u00d5s pain has been unusually concentrated.\n\nAnd it hasn\u00d5t been concentrated in the typical way. Nearly every region and every demographic group has indeed been affected. But the pain has been concentrated within groups.\n\nPeople who have lost their jobs are struggling terribly to find new ones. Since the downturn began in 2007, companies have been extremely reluctant to hire new workers, and few new companies have started. The economy and the job market are churning very slowly.\n\n\u00d2There are thousands of people applying for every job I\u00d5m looking at,\u00d3 Rick Alexander, an unemployed master carpenter in Florida, told my colleague Michael Luo. \u00d2And potential employers won\u00d5t even give me the courtesy of acknowledging I applied.\u00d3 Almost five million of the officially unemployed \u00d1 those still looking for work \u00d1 have now been out of work for 27 weeks or longer. In the six decades that the Labor Department has been keeping records, that group has never been a larger share of the work force than it is today.\n\nYet there is a flip side to the lack of churn. Instead of doing lots of firing and some hiring, many companies have done only some firing and virtually no hiring, the statistics show. And that isn\u00d5t all bad.\n\nTry thinking of it this way: All of the unemployed people in the country are gathered in a huge gymnasium that\u00d5s been turned into a job search center. The fact that this recession is the worst in a generation means that there are many, many people in the gym. The fact that the economy is churning so slowly means that there is not much traffic into and out of the gym.\n\nIf you\u00d5re inside, you will have a hard time getting out. Yet if you\u00d5re lucky enough to be outside the gym, you will probably be able to stay there. The consequences of a job loss are terribly high, but \u00d1 given that the unemployment rate is almost 10 percent \u00d1 the odds of job loss are surprisingly low.\n\nThe reasons for the slow churn are obviously complex. The baby boomers are moving out of the ages at which people typically start businesses. The economy has shifted away from sectors, like manufacturing, in which temporary layoffs are common. Educational gains have slowed, which affects innovation. And the federal government was not willing, at least until recently, to make the kind of investments that spurred entrepreneurship in the past \u00d1 building the highway system, supporting scientific research, creating the Pentagon computer network that turned into the Internet.\n\nBut whatever the causes, the effects of the slow churn are clear: the pain of this recession has been concentrated. That\u00d5s all the more true now that wages may be rising again.\n\nThe story about falling wages was \u00d1 and remains \u00d1 a reasonable one.\n\n\u00d2There\u00d5s been a huge shift in power in recent years from labor to capital,\u00d3 as the astute financial blogger Felix Salmon has written. Labor unions have shrunk, and companies can move operations to lower-wage countries. \u00d2Now that workers have lost their negotiating leverage,\u00d3 Mr. Salmon wrote after FedEx made its announcement, \u00d2we might start seeing more across-the-board pay cuts.\u00d3 If the economy were to weaken again, we still might.\n\nSo far, though, we haven\u00d5t. Between the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September and this June, the average weekly pay of rank-and-file workers (who make up 80 percent of the work force) remained stuck at about $612. Hourly pay rose a bit, but the increase was canceled out by a shrinking workweek. Since June \u00d1 with the economy apparently starting to grow again, as Ben Bernanke noted on Tuesday \u00d1 the workweek has grown and hourly pay growth has accelerated. Last month, average weekly pay rose to $618.\n\nMost companies have evidently decided that pay cuts aren\u00d5t worth the downside. Economists refer to this phenomenon as the sticky-wage theory, and it seems to have survived the Great Recession.\n\nThe theory holds that executives of companies don\u00d5t cut pay, even when demand for labor has fallen. They worry that employees will become less motivated or start looking for another job, says Laury Sejen, who oversees the compensation consultants at Watson Wyatt. So companies instead lay off workers or stop hiring. They concentrate the pain.\n\nThe added wrinkle in this recession is that inflation has dropped below zero, thanks largely to a sharp fall in energy prices. In most recessions, inflation remains positive \u00d1 indeed, higher than wage growth, which means that inflation-adjusted pay declines. In this recession, average prices have fallen 2 percent over the past year, while weekly pay has either been flat or risen 1 percent, depending on which data you believe.\n\nSo inflation-adjusted pay is up 2 to 3 percent. Amazingly enough, that\u00d5s almost as big as the peak increases during the late 1990s boom.\n\nI realize how strange this sounds. (I work at one of the companies that did cut pay.) House values have sunk, and 401(k) accounts remain battered. In the years leading up to the recession, pay increases for most families were meager. The Census Bureau reported last week that median real household income \u00d1 which, of course, includes households that have suffered a job loss \u00d1 was lower last year than a full decade earlier.\n\nBut we\u00d5re still in unusual territory. The economy is just emerging from a severe recession, yet the pay of most workers has been rising. That wasn\u00d5t the case at the end of any other recent recession.\n\nI hope you can keep this in mind if you\u00d5re one of those fortunate enough to be outside the metaphorical gymnasium and still working. The economy surely doesn\u00d5t feel healthy right now. But just imagine how it feels to everybody who has borne the brunt of the recession. "}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": "In the fall of 1982, with a long recession ending but the unemployment rate heading toward 10 percent, The New York Times ran an article titled \u00d2The Recovery That Won\u00d5t Start.\u00d3\n\nIt quoted prominent economists who worried that \u00d2the recovery may amount to nothing more than a few quarters of paltry growth \u00d1 and possibly not even that.\u00d3 The economists, the article noted, had \u00d2growing doubts about whether the mechanisms of economic recovery will \u00d1 or can \u00d1 operate as they have in other postwar business cycles.\u00d3\n\nOver the next two years, the American economy grew at a blistering annual rate of more than 6 percent.\n\nThese days, as in the aftermath of every recession, you are again hearing a version of those early 1980s worries: this time, things are different. Consumers are tapped out. Business executives are skittish. Banks remain reluctant to lend.\n\nAnd maybe things really are different this time. Given the many problems weighing on the economy, a mediocre recovery does indeed seem more likely than a strong one, as I\u00d5ve written before. But history certainly offers pessimists and semi-pessimists some cause for humility.\n\nOn Friday, the Labor Department will release its monthly jobs report, and it is a more important one than usual. For most of this year, the economy has been gradually but steadily improving. In September, though, it slid backward, with job losses rising and wage growth slowing.\n\nFriday\u00d5s report \u00d1 the first broad look at the economy in October \u00d1 should make clear whether September was the start of something worrisome or just a blip. It will count as good news if there were fewer than 200,000 job losses last month and if the losses have clearly slowed, once the revised numbers for earlier months are taken into account.\n\nEither way, the job market will still be in terrible shape. The unemployment rate, at 9.8 percent in September, could conceivably hit 10 percent for the first time since 1983. When that happens, some economists are bound to argue that the normal mechanisms of economic recovery have broken down.\n\nSo it\u00d5s a good time to remember that when an economy is just coming out of recession, its weaknesses are always more obvious than its potential strengths.\n\n\u00d2Of course, there is a long list of things to worry about,\u00d3 says Robert Barbera, an economist and the author of a recent book on the financial crisis. \u00d2But it\u00d5s ever thus. If that were the reason you didn\u00d5t have a genuine recovery, you would never have a genuine recovery.\u00d3\n\nPeople tend to become overly pessimistic at the end of a recession, partly because they can see that the forces behind the last boom \u00d1 housing and mortgage lending, in this case \u00d1 won\u00d5t be around for the next one. If anything, the excesses from the last boom seem likely to hold back the economy for years to come. People are left to wonder where future growth will come from.\n\nI want to take a stab at that question today. To be clear, I am not predicting a boom over the next two years. I\u00d5m just trying to give equal time to the side of the economic ledger that often doesn\u00d5t get discussed until after the fact.\n\nCHINA For years, economists have been saying that China needs to consume more and the United States needs to consume less. Now it\u00d5s starting to happen.\n\nThe Chinese government has increased spending in the country\u00d5s impoverished countryside and made it easier for households to borrow money. Meanwhile, the global recession has caused China\u00d5s export sector to shrink. Its trade surplus is on pace to equal about 4 percent of its gross domestic product this year, down from 9 percent in 2007. \u00d2Things have moved in a much more positive direction,\u00d3 says Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.\n\nBut for progress to continue, China will need to stop intervening in foreign exchange markets so aggressively and allow its currency to rise relative to the dollar. That would hurt Chinese manufacturers (by making their goods more expensive) while helping Chinese households (by making imports cheaper). It would also help American companies, because their goods and services would be cheaper to export to China.\n\nChinese officials have repeatedly said they want to rebalance their economy. Figuring out how to hold them to it is one of the big tasks facing the White House, the State Department and the Treasury.\n\nPENT-UP DEMAND Or to put it another way, how much less will Americans be consuming?\n\nThe shopping spree made possible by the housing bubble was clearly unsustainable. But no one really knows what the new normal is. It could look not so different from the frugality of 2009, or it could look like something between frugality and froth.\n\nMost economists say they think the second situation is far more likely. Vehicle sales are a good example. Households will buy about 10.5 million new vehicles this year, down from more than 16 million a year for most of this decade. Taking everything into account \u00d1 the hangover from the excess sales, population growth, the average life of a car \u00d1 Rebecca Lindland of the research firm IHS Global Insight said she expected the number to grow to 11.2 million next year, 13.7 million in 2011 and 15.5 million in 2012.\n\nThat\u00d5s not an especially bullish forecast. But it still suggests the auto sector will grow 30 percent over the next two years.\n\nSTIMULUS Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, said something unintentionally revealing last week: \u00d2We do not have plans for an additional stimulus package. But we do have plans to stimulate the economy.\u00d3\n\nEven though economists generally say the $787 billion stimulus bill has been a big success, it has only lukewarm public support, polls show. So the White House and Congress are reluctant to propose another stimulus bill. Yet the economy could use some more stimulus. Too many resources \u00d1 buildings, machines, workers \u00d1 are still sitting idle.\n\nThe solution may end up being some combination of smaller stimulus measures that dare not speak the name, like extended jobless benefits or the expanded (and misguided) home buyer\u00d5s credit. These programs won\u00d5t have the punch that the Federal Reserve\u00d5s sharp interest rate cuts in the early 1980s did. But the combination of today\u00d5s already-low interest rates, any new stimulus and the $30 billion in original stimulus money that Washington is still spending every month will be supporting the economy well into 2010.\n\nA side note to deficit hawks: Don\u00d5t be distracted by a few billion here or there from stimulus. The real action is with health reform, which has the potential to save hundreds of billions of dollars over the long term \u00d1 but only if Congress gets tough on wasteful medical spending.\n\nTHE UNKNOWN When Bill Clinton convened a conference in the dark economic days after his 1992 election, some of the country\u00d5s top economists flew to Little Rock, Ark., to share their vision for the future. As Rahm Emanuel, now the White House chief of staff, likes to point out, they didn\u00d5t spend much time talking about the Internet. They could not see the dot-com boom coming.\n\nMight there be another pleasant surprise in our future? Maybe cloud computing or some other form of information technology? Maybe a breakthrough in alternative energy?\n\nThe point is, no one knows. If someone forced me to make a prediction, I would guess that the economy would not feel truly healthy until at least 2011. Financial crises tend to have long hangovers, and this was the worst crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nBut I would also make another guess. A few years from now, everyone will be talking about some obvious economic blessing that isn\u00d5t so obvious today."}
{"klass": "david_leonhardt", "text": " After Harry Truman repeatedly failed to persuade Congress to pass universal health insurance, some Truman administration officials came up with a less ambitious idea. They suggested covering only 8 percent of the population, and an especially sympathetic 8 percent at that: everybody 65 and older.\n\nTruman never really pushed the plan, however. John F. Kennedy later did, yet was stymied by Congress and the American Medical Association, which equated it with Soviet-like socialism. So it fell to Lyndon Johnson. Even after he won a 23-point landslide in 1964, he had to agree to some unseemly deal-making, as Jonathan Cohn of The New Republic has noted, that handed a big payday to hospitals and doctors.\n\nOnly then, in the summer of 1965, was Medicare born.\n\nNext week, Congress will return to session, and health care, of course, will be at the top of its agenda. Passing a bill, it's clear, will be no easier than in previous decades. President Obama's poll numbers have fallen, while untruths about death panels have made the rounds and members of Congress have been subjected to town hall harangues.\n\nBut the job facing Mr. Obama hasn't really changed: he will have to figure out how to end up more like Johnson than like Truman or, more recently, Bill Clinton. He and Congress will have to figure out how to make some progress toward fixing the country's troubled health care system.\n\nAny bill they pass will inevitably be flawed. It will not do enough to reduce wasteful spending. It probably will not result in universal coverage. Special interests -- like drug companies and, once again, hospitals -- will get off too lightly.\n\nBut such is politics. Starting from scratch with a more purely liberal bill or a more conservative one, as some have urged, won't change the messy reality of democracy. ''You're not going to fix health care on one bill,'' Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said. ''Even if my most liberal colleagues had their perfect bill, it's not going to fix health care. A bill is going to have to be altered and amended later.''\n\nIndeed, from an economic standpoint, the biggest risk seems to be that health care will be left unchanged and that we'll simply pretend we are as healthy, wealthy and wise as can be.\n\nWe're not. The United States is the only rich country in the world without something resembling universal health insurance. Medical costs already take a big whack out of workers' paychecks, and Medicare's budget is growing at an unsustainable rate. Despite all this spending, we too often receive inadequate care.\n\nEmergency room care and certain cancer treatments are among the best in the world. But management of chronic diseases isn't nearly as good. Senior citizens and children are less likely to receive vaccinations here than in some other wealthy countries, a recent analysis found. Americans face higher risks of being killed by a medical error or harmed by a medication error.\n\nHealth reform won't solve all these problems. But there is still reason to think that it can improve things. A limited, imperfect, warts-and-all bill would, as in 1965, be a lot better than no bill at all.\n\nThe main political problem with health reform is still the immediate cost of it. Covering the uninsured will require $1.2 trillion or so over 10 years, and Congress hasn't been able to agree on $1.2 trillion of spending cuts and tax increases to keep the deficit from growing.\n\nThis standard -- deficit neutrality -- may not be fair. George W. Bush, after all, spent trillions of dollars cutting taxes and adding a Medicare prescription drug benefit without offsetting the costs. Yet given the current size of the deficit, Mr. Obama and Congress have to do better. "}

On Monday, Christina Romer, the chairwoman of Mr. Obama\u00d5s Council of Economic Advisers, gave a speech in which she said the deficit was \u00d2simply not a problem that can be kicked down the road indefinitely.\u00d3\n\nJust about everybody agrees that solving the deficit depends on reducing the benefits that current law has promised to retirees, via Medicare and Social Security. That\u00d5s not how people usually put it, of course. They tend to use the more soothing phrase \u00d2entitlement reform.\u00d3 But entitlement reform is just another way of saying that we can\u00d5t pay more in benefits than we collect in taxes.\n\n\u00d2If the long-term issue is entitlement reform,\u00d3 says Joel Slemrod, a University of Michigan economist, \u00d2the fact that the political system cannot say no to $250 checks to elderly people is a bad sign.\u00d3\n\n\nThe first Social Security check was mailed in 1940 to Ida May Fuller, a retired legal secretary in Ludlow, Vt. It was for $22.54. Every month for the next 10 years, Ms. Fuller received a check for that same amount.\n\nThe original Social Security legislation had not included an inflation adjustment, which meant benefits did not keep up with the cost of living. A decade later, Ms. Fuller\u00d5s checks were worth about 40 percent less in real terms than when she started receiving them.\n\nCongress finally increased benefits in 1950 and then continued to do so in fits and starts, sometimes faster than inflation, sometimes slower and usually in an election year. President Richard M. Nixon and a Democratic Congress brought some order to this process in 1972, by automatically tying benefits to the movement of an inflation index in the previous year.\n\nThe changes were part of the transformation, during the middle decades of the 20th century, in how this country treated the elderly. In the 1930s, they had little safety net and frequently struggled to meet their basic needs. Four decades later, they were the only group of Americans with guaranteed health care and a guaranteed income. All in all, it was certainly for the good.\n\nBut by the 1970s, you could start to see the early signs of excess. In their bill, Mr. Nixon and Congress included a little bonus: Social Security payments could never decline, even if prices did. If prices went up, benefits matched the increase. If prices went down, benefits would be held constant \u00d0 and their purchasing power would actually grow. Heads, it\u00d5s a tie; tails, Social Security recipients win.\n\nThis year, the coin finally came up tails.\n\nWith oil prices plunging and other prices falling, last year\u00d5s high inflation (which led to the 5.8 percent increase in Social Security payments) has turned into deflation. Overall prices have dropped 2.1 percent in the last year, according to the relevant price index.\n\nSocial Security payments, however, will remain as they were, which means that recipients are already set to receive an effective raise, even without Mr. Obama\u00d5s $250 checks. No matter what happens with that proposal, 2010 will be the first year since at least the Nixon era that the buying power of an individual worker\u00d5s Social Security goes up.\n\nCompare that to what\u00d5s happening with minimum-wage workers in Colorado. Their wage is also tied to inflation, but it has no floor. So it will fall slightly next year, to keep pace with prices.\n\nNow, I understand that there are arguments on the other side of the issue. Lawrence Summers, Mr. Obama\u00d5s top economics aide, pointed out that the stimulus bill included one-time $250 payments for Social Security recipients, which were sent out this year, but tax cuts for workers both this year and next year. \u00d2We\u00d5re correcting an anomaly,\u00d3 he told me.\n\nOthers will argue that the elderly simply need help. Some have been the victim of age discrimination. Too many still live in poverty. All of them are likely to see their Medicare copayments rise in 2010. This recession has spared no group.\n\nBut older Americans really have survived the recession better than most.\n\nMany of them started buying assets years if not decades ago, meaning they were not the main victims of the stock and housing bubbles. They had a cushion. In addition, relatively few of them work in manufacturing or construction, the hardest-hit industries.\n\nJust consider: The real median income of over-65 households rose 3 percent from 2000 to 2008. For households headed by somebody age 25 to 44, it fell about 7 percent.\n\nEconomic policy, like most everything else, is about making choices. Mr. Obama is choosing the elderly, rich and poor, to be more worthy of $14 billion in government checks than struggling workers or schoolchildren. Republicans have pandered in their own ways, choosing to oppose just about any cut in Medicare and, in effect, to stick your grandchildren with an enormous tax bill.\n\nIn a way, I understand where the politicians are coming from. We voters may say that we are in favor of cutting the deficit, but usually mean it in only the theoretical sense. Who wants their own benefits cut? For that matter, who is even willing to have their Social Security checks hold steady? "}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "In January, Mike Rowland was so broke that he had to raid his retirement savings to move here from Boston.\n\nPolicy changes in insurance, while introduced on a temporary basis, are becoming so popular that they could prove difficult to undo.\n\nA week ago, he and a couple of buddies bought a two-unit apartment building for nearly a million dollars. They had only a little cash to bring to the table but, with the federal government insuring the transaction, a large down payment was not necessary.\n\n\u00d2It was kind of crazy we could get this big a loan,\u00d3 said Mr. Rowland, 27. \u00d2If a government official came out here, I would slap him a high-five.\u00d3\n\nIn its efforts to prop up a shattered housing market, the government is greatly extending its traditional support of real estate, including guaranteeing the mortgages of middle-class and even upper-class buyers against default.\n\nIn 2007, the government did not insure a single mortgage in this city, one of the most expensive in the country. Buyers here, as well as in Manhattan, Santa Monica and every other wealthy area, were presumed to be able to handle the steep prices and correspondingly hefty down payments on their own.\n\nNow the government is guaranteeing an average of six mortgages a week here. Real estate agents say the insurance is such a good deal that there will soon be many more.\n\nPolicy changes like the shift in insurance, while often introduced on a temporary basis, are becoming so popular that they could prove difficult to undo. With government finances already under great strain, the policy expansions are creating new risks for American taxpayers.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service is giving tax rebates to first-time buyers, and soon to move-up buyers, in a program beset by accusations of fraud. And the government agency that issues mortgage insurance, the Federal Housing Administration, is underwriting loans at quadruple the rate of three years ago even as its reserves to cover defaults are dwindling. On Thursday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said more than one in six F.H.A. borrowers was behind on payments.\n\nF.H.A. insurance was created for minority and low-income families who could not come up with the traditional down payment of 20 percent required by private lenders. Buyers receive loans from government-approved lenders and are required to document their income and assets. They must pay a substantial insurance premium of 1.75 percent of the loan. But in return, their down payment can be as low as 3.5 percent.\n\nFor decades, most F.H.A. loans were in low-cost states like Texas and Michigan. Under the agency\u00d5s loan limits, houses along the coasts were usually too expensive to qualify. In 2007, fewer than 4,400 F.H.A. loans were made in California, according to the research firm MDA DataQuick, and none were in San Francisco.\n\nThe Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 helped change that by temporarily doubling the maximum loan the F.H.A. insured, to $729,750. A two-unit property like the one bought by Mr. Rowland and his friends can be insured for up to $934,200.\n\n\u00d2F.H.A. financing was a lost language in San Francisco, the real estate equivalent of Aramaic,\u00d3 said Michael Ackerman, the agent who represented Mr. Rowland and his friends. \u00d2Once the limits were raised, smart buyers started calling.\u00d3\n\nThe F.H.A. has insured more than 107,000 loans so far this year in the state, according to DataQuick, about 270 of them in San Francisco.\n\nCondominium buildings approved for F.H.A. financing \u00d1 a relative handful \u00d1 trumpet the news on their Web sites. The Soma Grand, a new 246-unit building downtown where one-bedrooms cost in excess of $500,000, received F.H.A. certification early in the summer. A half-dozen buyers since then used F.H.A. insurance.\n\nAt Guarantee Mortgage Corporation, which has 150 mortgage brokers in the Bay Area, Seattle and Portland, Ore., F.H.A. loans have grown to about 15 percent of its business, from less than 3 percent a few years ago.\n\n\u00d2It sure has helped us put a lot of deals together,\u00d3 said Guarantee\u00d5s chief sales officer, Bob Siefert. He predicts that a quarter of Guarantee\u00d5s deals will soon be guaranteed by the F.H.A.\n\nSome F.H.A. borrowers here say they have the cash for a full down payment but would rather invest it in the stock market or use it for remodeling. Others, like Mr. Rowland and his friends, simply do not have the money required by private lenders \u00d1 which would have been nearly $200,000, in their case."}

Rick Perry of Texas is asking the Environmental Protection Agency to temporarily waive regulations requiring the oil industry to blend ever-increasing amounts of ethanol into gasoline. A decision is expected in the next few weeks.\n\nMr. Perry says the billions of bushels of corn being used to produce all that mandated ethanol would be better suited as livestock feed than as fuel.\n\nFeed prices have soared in the last two years as fuel has begun competing with food for cropland.\n\n\u00d2When you find yourself in a hole, you have to quit digging,\u00d3 Mr. Perry said in an interview. \u00d2And we are in a hole.\u00d3\n\nHis request for an emergency waiver cutting the ethanol mandate to 4.5 billion gallons, from the 9 billion gallons required this year and the 10.5 billion required in 2009, is backed by a coalition of food, livestock and environmental groups.\n\nFarmers and ethanol and other biofuel producers are lobbying to keep the existing mandates.\n\n\u00d2This is a critically important decision that will determine the future of biofuels in this country,\u00d3 said Brent Erickson, a lobbyist at the Biotechnology Industry Organization, which supports the ethanol mandates. \u00d2There will be a dramatic reaction from whoever loses.\u00d3\n\nThe E.P.A. received 15,000 public comments on the Texas proposal, roughly split between those in favor and those against.\n\nLHT Inc., an infrastructure company, said it never would have spent tens of millions of dollars developing delivery pipes for ethanol without the mandated increases. \u00d2How do we get our money back?\u00d3 an executive asked.\n\nO.K. Industries, a poultry company in Arkansas upset about rising feed costs, said this was the first year since the company was founded during the Great Depression that it could not afford to give its employees a wage increase.\n\nAn agency spokesman said the E.P.A. can approve the request, deny it or take a middle path. The deadline is Thursday, but the agency says it needs more time to review public comments and formulate a decision.\n\nThe agency\u00d5s authority derives from a 2005 energy law that sets some of the most important ethanol quotas. The law says states can petition the agency for a reduction in the ethanol mandates on the grounds of severe harm to the economy or environment. Decisions must be made after consultation with the secretaries of energy and agriculture.\n\nEthanol is under siege from other quarters. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, has introduced legislation calling for a freeze of the mandate at the current level, saying it \u00d2is clearly causing unintended consequences on food prices.\u00d3 The measure is co-sponsored by 11 other Republican senators, including John McCain, the presumptive presidential nominee.\n\nThe Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, testified last week that \u00d2it would be helpful\u00d3 to remove a 51-cent-a-gallon tariff on imported Brazilian ethanol. If Brazilian ethanol enters the United States market, domestic producers argue, the industry will suffer.\n\nIn a new report, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is critical of biofuels, saying further development will raise food prices while doing little for energy security.\n\nBut the attempts to undercut ethanol are proving divisive. Mr. Perry said he hoped the other 49 governors would join him, but was able to cite only one that had: Gov. M. Jodi Rell of Connecticut. (A spokesman for Mrs. Rell declined to offer a full-fledged endorsement of Mr. Perry\u00d5s initiative, saying she supported a modification of the mandate but had not made any specific proposals.)\n\nIn ethanol\u00d5s home ground of the Midwest, where much of the corn is grown and the additive is made, Mr. Perry\u00d5s petition was opposed by 12 governors. Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, accused the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the group leading the public relations fight against ethanol, of \u00d2treasonous\u00d3 acts.\n\nMr. Perry is also being accused of bad motives. The Houston Chronicle reported that his interest in a rollback developed after Lonnie Pilgrim, senior chairman of the East Texas chicken company Pilgrim\u00d5s Pride, donated $100,000 to the Republican Governors Association, of which Mr. Perry is the chairman.\n\nThe governor brushed aside such concerns. \u00d2I have always been of the position that when your opposition has to point to a political contribution rather than trying to make their debate on the issues, they might be losing,\u00d3 he said.\n\nCorn growers and ethanol producers believe they are being made scapegoats for failed economic and energy policies. Corn futures have already dropped sharply from the record highs set a month ago. Midwest weather has been favorable in recent weeks, raising expectations for the size and quality of the crop.\n\nMark Williams, who grows corn on 2,500 acres in the Texas panhandle, dreads a further price drop. \u00d2Our costs have increased so much, we need a pretty good price to make a little living,\u00d3 he said. Furthermore, he added that it would be unfair to change the rules at this point. \u00d2We bought fertilizer and corn seed, decided our crop mix on the basis of ethanol being where it was. To change that mandate in the middle of our growing season, that\u00d5s really not right.\u00d3\n\nA cut in the mandate might be the beginning of a slippery slope that could mark the end for ethanol, said Lee Reeve, one of the pioneers of the industry. His Garden City, Kan., plant has been in operation since 1982. \u00d2If this goes through, I guarantee you that by next Thursday there would be arguments about how we should get rid of the mandate entirely,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2And where are you going to find the oil to replace eight or nine billion gallons of ethanol?\u00d3"}

He pointed to the Kashmir granite in the kitchen. \"It's nice, no?\"\n\nNow if only they could get the keys and go inside, instead of peering in the windows like a couple of peeping toms.\n\nThe house, on which the couple made a down payment of $88,820, is empty. Their belongings are in storage. They live, unhappily, in a hotel.\n\n\"It's very upsetting, not to be allowed in our own house,\" Larisa Costanzo, a Russian immigrant, said. \"Please take our money and let us move in.\"\n\nTheir builder is Levitt & Sons, which ran out of cash in October and declared bankruptcy in November. All work on this planned 460-home development for retirees, grandly named Seasons at Prince Creek West, has ceased. The Levitt employees were laid off, the subcontractors put down their tools, and the Costanzos found themselves in limbo.\n\nThe first big home builder to fail in the current slump, Levitt's collapse illustrates how the turmoil in real estate is spreading far beyond subprime borrowers who cannot pay their mortgages. Levitt had a fabled brand, decades of experience and enthusiastic customers with good credit, but that was not enough to save it.\n\nPaul Singerman, Levitt's bankruptcy attorney, said that as the real estate market in Florida went into \"an absolutely unprecedented and catastrophic downturn,\" the builder's customers across the Southeast became victims. \"There is a bad story, an unfortunate story, about every customer that placed a deposit,\" Singerman said.\n\nSeasons is less than a quarter finished. About 90 buyers have paid a total of $3.47 million in deposits for houses in varying stages of completion, ranging from all but done, like the Costanzos', to unadorned dirt.\n\nAnother 90 houses are occupied, but many of these residents are, if anything, even more unhappy than the depositors. Levitt sold them on a community where everything would be taken care of. Those assurances mean little now.\n\n\"I can't believe we're dealing with Levitt & Sons,\" said Nancy Harth, 59, who moved in last March. \"It feels like a start-up company.\"\n\nThe initial popularity of Levitt's 18 retirement communities, at least four of which are in as much disarray as Seasons, is testament to a durable name.\n\nSixty years ago, Levitt began mass-producing homes on a patch of Long Island potato fields. It quickly built tens of thousands of houses in Long Island, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, creating the modern suburb in the process.\n\nIn recent years, the builder has been concentrating on projects for the children of the Levittown generation, the 78 million aging baby boomers. Its sales strategy leaned heavily on both the company's long operating history and its long-ago achievements.\n\nThe pitch worked, brilliantly.\n\nChristine Roberts was born in Queens in 1966. Six months later, her parents moved to Levittown, and Roberts lived there for 38 years. \"Buying at Seasons meant I was still going to be part of a Levitt community,\" she said. \"We thought that was so cool.\"\n\nNow the Robertses, like the Costanzos, are full of uncertainty. They sold their Long Island home a year ago in preparation for their move to Seasons, and bought $10,000 of new furniture. With their Seasons house unfinished, they have been living in a trailer they own in the Poconos. The furniture is in storage in South Carolina.\n\n\"We didn't think anything bad was going to happen,\" said Roberts, a former U.S. Postal Service worker. \"We really and truly had the utmost faith.\"\n\nMany of the Seasons buyers came from the New York area. South Carolina offered a milder climate, lower taxes, less congestion and more golf.\n\nNancy Darr, 61, has macular degeneration, an eye condition that prevents her from driving and makes her unable to distinguish between a flower and a weed. She wanted a house, but could not do the upkeep.\n\nSeasons promised to take care of her concerns. The gated community would have 24-hour security. An activities director would arrange entertainment. Owners would not have to mow their lawns. Even their bushes were to be fed by a central irrigation system."}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "The Federal Housing Administration, the government agency whose loan-insurance programs have become a crucial source of support for the housing market, said on Thursday that its cash reserves had dwindled significantly in the last year as more borrowers defaulted on their mortgages.\n\n\u00d2There is a real risk. Nobody has a crystal ball,\u00d3 said Shaun Donovan, secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nThe agency released an audit that spelled out the rapid deterioration of its finances. It is tightening loan standards in hopes it will not become another drain on the United States Treasury, but is reluctant to clamp down so much that it snuffs out the tentative recovery in housing.\n\nHow successfully the agency walks this tightrope could well determine whether the recovery gathers force, or whether home prices slide again \u00d1 perhaps creating a fresh economic downturn.\n\nAs recently as a few weeks ago, the F.H.A. had said that even under the bleakest economic forecast, its cash cushion would quickly recover. On Thursday, it abandoned that position.\n\n\u00d2There is a real risk. Nobody has a crystal ball,\u00d3 Shaun Donovan, secretary of housing and urban development, said in an interview. \u00d2We recognize there is a possibility that the reserves go below zero and stay there.\u00d3\n\nStill, Mr. Donovan stressed that the agency, which had a role in one out of five home purchases in the last year, would not need a direct taxpayer bailout.\n\n\u00d2There is no extraordinary action that Congress or anyone else needs to take,\u00d3 he said during a news conference in Washington.\n\nInstead, the agency would borrow from the Treasury, under authority previously granted by Congress. In the worst case, involving a protracted recession, the audit said the F.H.A. would run out of capital in 2011 and have to borrow $1.6 billion from the Treasury to pay insurance claims, a relatively small sum.\n\nThat is not a situation the agency considers likely. In line with many analysts, the agency expects the housing market to turn down again over the next nine months and then to recover. Under this projection, foreclosures would be manageable and the reserves would quickly grow.\n\nThe F.H.A.\u00d5s annual audit was scheduled for release last week, but was mysteriously delayed at the last minute. On Thursday, as it released the document, the agency explained that it wanted its auditors to include more negative forecasts as a way of understanding the worst-case risk.\n\nThe audit showed reserves to be 0.53 percent of the total portfolio, far below the 2 percent minimum mandated by Congress and far less than the audit last year had forecast. In 2007, just before housing prices began their worst slump in decades, the reserves were above 6 percent.\n\nAnn Schnare, a consultant who has analyzed the F.H.A. balance sheet, put the situation this way: \u00d2They\u00d5re running on empty.\u00d3\n\nAs the fortunes of the F.H.A. have deteriorated over the last few months, the agency has become a focal point for dissatisfaction over federal efforts to prop up the housing market.\n\nIt is drawing comparisons to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant agencies created by Congress to keep the mortgage market supplied with cash by buying up pools of home loans. With borrowers defaulting in the downturn, Fannie and Freddie have required enormous bailouts.\n\nThe F.H.A.\u00d5s role differs from that of Fannie and Freddie. Through its insurance, it helps marginal buyers get loans if they do not have the 20 percent down payment a traditional bank loan requires. The agency requires a 3.5 percent down payment. Critics say it went overboard and insured too many loans to unqualified borrowers in 2007 and 2008, a position with which the agency itself now agrees.\n\nNearly one in five loans it insured in 2007 falls into the category of \u00d2seriously delinquent,\u00d3 it said Thursday. These loanholders are at least three months behind in their payments. For 2008 loans, 12 percent of them were seriously delinquent.\n\nThe F.H.A. says it is insuring loans to more financially secure buyers with higher credit scores. The average credit score of new borrowers, it said, is 693, compared with 633 two years ago.\n\nIn a sense, the agency is bulking up and giving as many loans as it can to qualified buyers as a way to diminish the relative size of the pool of problem loans. It guaranteed more than $360 billion in mortgages in the last year, four times the amount of 2007.\n\nCritics say this is only increasing the size of the ultimate peril.\n\n\u00d2They keep saying they\u00d5re going to outrun their problems, but some way, somehow, the taxpayer is going to end up on the hook,\u00d3 said Edward Pinto, a former executive with Fannie Mae.\n\nDuring the news conference, Secretary Donovan and the agency\u00d5s commissioner, David H. Stevens, said that the cash reserve, the figure that has fallen to 0.53 percent of loans outstanding, was merely a supplement to a much larger fund that the F.H.A. was holding against expected losses. Between the two accounts, the agency has $31 billion to cover losses over the next 30 years.\n\nThe F.H.A.\u00d5s problems stem from its rapid transition from a wallflower to the most popular student in class.\n\nDuring the housing boom, buyers flocked to private subprime lenders, who offered deals that required no money down and no documentation. The F.H.A., which required its token down payment and documentation of the borrower\u00d5s earning power, lost ground.\n\nBut as the market tumbled and the subprime outfits failed, F.H.A. loans became the next best thing. Brian Montgomery, who ran the F.H.A. for the Bush administration, said in a recent interview that the agency felt it had no choice but to open the doors to a broader group of applicants.\n\nCiting pressure from Congress and the White House, Mr. Montgomery said: \u00d2We had to let these loans through.\u00d3\n\nMr. Montgomery, now a consultant, says that anyone dismayed by the possibility of yet another bailout should feel a different emotion toward the Department of Housing and Urban Development and, for that matter, himself: gratitude.\n\n\u00d2They should be going over to the H.U.D. building and frankly thanking the career staff for saving them from a depression,\u00d3 Mr. Montgomery said."}

In 1980, one out of 10 area workers was in the steel industry.\n\nUnemployment is 5.5 percent, far below the national average. While housing prices sank nearly everywhere in the last year, they rose here. Wages are also up. Foreclosures are comparatively uncommon.\n\nA generation ago, the steel industry that built Pittsburgh and still dominated its economy entered its death throes. In the early 1980s, the city was being talked about the way Detroit is now. Its very survival was in question.\n\nDeindustrialization in Pittsburgh was a protracted and painful experience. Yet it set the stage for an economy that is the envy of many recession-plagued communities, particularly those where the automobile industry is struggling for its life.\n\n\u00d2If people are looking for hope, it\u00d5s here,\u00d3 said Sabina Deitrick, an urban studies expert at the University of Pittsburgh. \u00d2You can have a decent economy over a long period of restructuring.\u00d3\n\nPittsburgh\u00d5s transition has been proceeding for decades in fits and starts, benefiting some areas much more than others. A development plan begun in the 1980s successfully used the local universities to pour state funds into technology research.\n\nEntrepreneurship bloomed in computer software and biotechnology. Two of the biggest sectors are education and health care, among the most resistant to downturns. Prominent companies are doing well. Westinghouse Electric, a builder of nuclear reactors, expects to hire 350 new employees a year for the foreseeable future. And commercial construction, plunging in most places, is still thriving partly because of big projects like a casino and an arena for the Penguins hockey team.\n\nThe question is whether Pittsburgh can serve as a model for Detroit and other cities in the industrial Midwest as they grapple with large-scale cutbacks in the automotive industry. Even with the federal government\u00d5s $17.4 billion bailout, General Motors, Chrysler and Ford are expected to continue shrinking.\n\nThe unemployment rate in Michigan, already close to 10 percent, will undoubtedly rise further. State and federal officials will have to increase the number of retraining programs, and develop a postindustrial policy that ensures there is something for the graduates to do. That will take patience and money, two commodities in short supply.\n\nAbout 4 percent of Michigan workers make cars and parts, with many more employed in related fields. Few regions are as dependent on a single heavy industry. But the history of Pittsburgh, where steel workers fell from as much as 10 percent of the work force in 1980 to less than 1 percent today, offers proof that revitalization is possible.\n\nOne reason Pittsburgh looks better in the bust is because it never had a real estate boom. That might have been a cause for complaint among homeowners who missed out on soaring values in California and Florida in the first half of the decade, but these days they can only be grateful.\n\nHousing prices in Pittsburgh were up 2.2 percent for the year ending September 2008 despite a slight drop in the latest quarter, according to the government\u00d5s House Price Index. That compares with a 4 percent drop for the United States as a whole.\n\nThe big local bank, PNC, was resolutely unadventurous during the housing frenzy. It just acquired Cleveland-based National City, which made too many bad loans. That will solidify Pittsburgh\u00d5s standing as one of the country\u00d5s major banking centers.\n\nYet the semisweet spot that Pittsburgh finds itself in was never inevitable. As recently as 2000, it had a higher unemployment rate than Detroit or Cleveland. Just as Michigan has traditionally put all its chips on the auto industry, it took Pittsburgh a long time to come to terms with the end of the steel era.\n\n\u00d2The emphasis was on fighting the presumed causes of the decline by getting rid of low-cost foreign imports or providing more subsidies,\u00d3 said Harold D. Miller, president of Future Strategies, a consultancy. \u00d2The assumption was that steel will come back and we\u00d5ll go back to the way we were.\u00d3\n\nThere were moments when the rebirth of steel seemed plausible, if not imminent. Ryan Campbell grew up in the shadow of the great Homestead Works, now the site of a vibrant shopping mall. When he graduated from college in 2001, steel drew him in.\n\nMr. Campbell took a job at a small specialty mill as a foreman. He loved it \u00d1 the huge cranes delicately pouring pots of molten fire, the camaraderie on the production line, the proud heritage of making something tangible \u00d1 but soon realized he could never make a career there.\n\n"}

A tailor in Lagos, Nigeria, named Abel Ojuku said recently that he had been forced to cut back on the bread he and his family love.\n\n\u00d2If you wanted to buy three loaves, now you buy one,\u00d3 Mr. Ojuku said.\n\nEverywhere, the cost of food is rising sharply. Whether the world is in for a long period of continued increases has become one of the most urgent issues in economics.\n\nMany factors are contributing to the rise, but the biggest is runaway demand. In recent years, the world\u00d5s developing countries have been growing about 7 percent a year, an unusually rapid rate by historical standards.\n\nThe high growth rate means hundreds of millions of people are, for the first time, getting access to the basics of life, including a better diet. That jump in demand is helping to drive up the prices of agricultural commodities.\n\nFarmers the world over are producing flat-out. American agricultural exports are expected to increase 23 percent this year to $101 billion, a record. The world\u00d5s grain stockpiles have fallen to the lowest levels in decades.\n\n\u00d2Everyone wants to eat like an American on this globe,\u00d3 said Daniel W. Basse of the AgResource Company, a Chicago consultancy. \u00d2But if they do, we\u00d5re going to need another two or three globes to grow it all.\u00d3\n\nIn contrast to a run-up in the 1990s, investors this time are betting \u00d1 as they buy and sell contracts for future delivery of food commodities \u00d1 that scarcity and high prices will last for years.\n\nIf that comes to pass, it is likely to present big problems in managing the American economy. Rising food prices in the United States are already helping to fuel inflation reminiscent of the 1970s.\n\nAnd the increases could become an even bigger problem overseas. The increases that have already occurred are depriving poor people of food, setting off social unrest and even spurring riots in some countries.\n\nIn the long run, the food supply could grow. More land may be pulled into production, and outdated farming methods in some countries may be upgraded. Moreover, rising prices could force more people to cut back. The big question is whether such changes will be enough to bring supply and demand into better balance.\n\n\u00d2People are trying to figure out, is this a new era?\u00d3 said Joseph Glauber, chief economist for the United States Department of Agriculture. \u00d2Are prices going to be high forever?\u00d3\n\nCompetition for Acres\n\nAt a moment when much of the country is contemplating recession, farmers are flourishing. The Agriculture Department forecasts that farm income this year will be 50 percent greater than the average of the last 10 years. The flood of money into American agriculture is leading to rising land values and a renewed sense of optimism in rural America.\n\n\u00d2All of a sudden farmers are more in control, which is a weird position for them,\u00d3 said Brian Sorenson of the Northern Crops Institute in Fargo, N.D. \u00d2Everyone\u00d5s knocking at their door, saying, \u00d4Grow this, grow that.\u00d5 \u00d3\n\nMr. Miller\u00d5s family has worked the Great Plains for more than a century. One afternoon early last month, he turned on the computer in his combination office and laundry room to see what commodity prices were up to.\n\n\u00d2Oh, my goodness, look at that,\u00d3 Mr. Miller said. Barley was $6.40 a bushel, approaching a price that would tempt him to plant more. Soybeans were $12.79 a bushel, up from $8.50 in August.\n\nThe frozen earth outside was only a few weeks from coming to life, but Mr. Miller was happily uncertain about what to plant. Last year, the decision was easy for Mr. Miller and everyone else: prices of corn were high because of new government mandates for production of ethanol, a motor fuel. This year, so many crops look like good bets, and there is so little land on which to plant them.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5m debating between spring wheat, durum wheat, canola, malting barley, confection sunflowers, oil sunflowers, soybeans, flax and corn,\u00d3 Mr. Miller said."}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "For decades, wheat was a commodity no American needed to think much about, except the farmers who grew it. The grain was usually plentiful and prices were low.\n\nThe wheat harvest in Kansas last June. \u00d2Anyone who tells you they\u00d5ve seen something like this is a liar,\u00d3 one trader said.\n\nAll of a sudden, those assumptions have been turned upside down. With demand soaring abroad and droughts crimping supply, the world\u00d5s wheat stockpiles have fallen to their lowest level in 30 years, and stocks in the United States have dropped to levels unseen since 1948.\n\nPrices have been gyrating in recent days as traders tried to figure out what to make of the situation. On Tuesday, prices for a sought-after variety, spring wheat, jumped to $16.73 a bushel on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, the latest of several records.\n\nPrices for common wheat are up nearly 50 percent since August, and they are up even more for the most sought-after varieties, leaving buyers, growers and longtime commodity traders shaking their heads.\n\n\u00d2Anyone who tells you they\u00d5ve seen something like this is a liar,\u00d3 said Vince Boddicker of the Farmers Trading Company in Mitchell, S.D.\n\nThough this week\u00d5s prices were nominal records, the inflation-adjusted record for wheat was set in the mid-1970s, when it exceeded $20 a bushel in today\u00d5s dollars after huge sales to the Soviet Union.\n\nForeign buying is driving this market, too, but these buyers include South Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela. Economic growth abroad has given people the means to improve their diets, and they are developing a taste for products made from wheat.\n\n\u00d2We haven\u00d5t hit a price that has slowed the international interest,\u00d3 said Joe Victor of the commodity research firm Allendale. \u00d2That is something that definitely has the market excited.\u00d3\n\nAmong the consequences are stretched wallets at home and abroad as food processors pass along higher costs.\n\n\u00d2When the price of your raw material quadruples, you can\u00d5t afford not to raise your prices,\u00d3 said Timothy Dodd, president and chief executive of the Dakota Growers Pasta Company in Carrington, N.D. \u00d2Otherwise you\u00d5re out of business.\u00d3\n\nIn a Jan. 30 conference call, the chief executive of Kellogg, A. D. David Mackay, said, \u00d2Everyone is feeling these inflationary pressures.\u00d3 General Mills cited rising ingredient costs when it increased cereal prices last June.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that world wheat production will rise this year to nearly 664 million tons, from about 655 million tons \u00d1 not enough to replenish stocks and push down prices. In December, the organization noted that high international grain prices were causing food shortages, hoarding and even riots in some places.\n\nTo damp volatility, three United States exchanges that trade wheat futures contracts have raised the daily limit on price movements from 30 cents to 60 cents during the past week.\n\nFor the moment, the mania appeared to be halted in Chicago and Kansas City. March prices for soft red winter wheat, a low-protein wheat that is less favored than spring wheat, fell 41 cents Tuesday, to $10.07, in Chicago.\n\nEgypt put out an offer for a large wheat purchase on Monday, but chose not to buy any. That prompted speculation that it was waiting for prices to fall. But Japan was reported to be bidding for 85,000 tons of American spring wheat.\n\n\u00d2When the last person who has to buy in a market does so, you have a top,\u00d3 Mr. Boddicker said. \u00d2We\u00d5re quickly approaching that point, if we haven\u00d5t hit it already.\u00d3\n\nFew farmers have enough wheat on hand to take advantage of the recent increases, the trader said. Most sold last fall for prices that seemed good at the time.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture\u00d5s 10-year forecast, released Tuesday, sees the wheat shortage as temporary. Stockpiles were predicted to fall this year to 312 million bushels, from 456 million bushels, before rebounding to about 700 million bushels by the end of the decade.\n\nHigher prices \u00d2will encourage additional acreage and production,\u00d3 the report said. Wheat plantings will rise to 65 million acres in the 2008-9 season, from 60.4 million this year, the Agriculture Department said, though it predicted the number would then fall because of competition from other crops.\n"}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "A grandson of Mexican immigrants and a former mayor of this town, Henry G. Cisneros has spent years trying to make the dream of homeownership come true for low-income families.\n\nTHE DEVELOPER Henry Cisneros in his office in San Antonio with Sylvia Arce-Garcia, an executive assistant. He is the head of CityView, a developer.\n\nAs the Clinton administration\u00d5s top housing official in the mid-1990s, Mr. Cisneros loosened mortgage restrictions so first-time buyers could qualify for loans they could never get before.\n\nThen, capitalizing on a housing expansion he helped unleash, he joined the boards of a major builder, KB Home, and the largest mortgage lender in the nation, Countrywide Financial \u00d1 two companies that rode the housing boom, drawing criticism along the way for abusive business practices.\n\nAnd Mr. Cisneros became a developer himself. The Lago Vista development here in his hometown once stood as a testament to his life\u00d5s work.\n\nJoining with KB, he built 428 homes for low-income buyers in what was a neglected, industrial neighborhood. He often made the trip from downtown to ask residents if they were happy.\n\n\u00d2People bought here because of Cisneros,\u00d3 says Celia Morales, a Lago Vista resident. \u00d2There was a feeling of, \u00d4He\u00d5s got our back.\u00d5 \u00d3\n\nBut Mr. Cisneros rarely comes around anymore. Lago Vista, like many communities born in the housing boom, is now under stress. Scores of homes have been foreclosed, including one in five over the last six years on the community\u00d5s longest street, Sunbend Falls, according to property records.\n\nWhile Mr. Cisneros says he remains proud of his work, he has misgivings over what his passion has wrought. He insists that the worst problems developed only after \u00d2bad actors\u00d3 hijacked his good intentions but acknowledges that \u00d2people came to homeownership who should not have been homeowners.\u00d3\n\nThey were lured by \u00d2unscrupulous participants \u00d1 bankers, brokers, secondary market people,\u00d3 he says. \u00d2The country is paying for that, and families are hurt because we as a society did not draw a line.\u00d3\n\nThe causes of the housing implosion are many: lax regulation, financial innovation gone awry, excessive debt, raw greed. The players are also varied: bankers, borrowers, developers, politicians and bureaucrats.\n\nMr. Cisneros, 61, had a foot in a number of those worlds. Despite his qualms, he encouraged the unprepared to buy homes \u00d1 part of a broad national trend with dire economic consequences.\n\nHe reflects often on his role in the debacle, he says, which has changed homeownership from something that secured a place in the middle class to something that is ejecting people from it. \u00d2I\u00d5ve been waiting for someone to put all the blame at my doorstep,\u00d3 he says lightly, but with a bit of worry, too.\n\nThe Paydays During the Boom\n\nAfter a sex scandal destroyed his promising political career and he left Washington, he eventually reinvented himself as a well-regarded advocate and builder of urban, working-class homes. He has financed the construction of more than 7,000 houses.\n\nFor the three years he was a director at KB Home, Mr. Cisneros received at least $70,000 in pay and more than $100,000 worth of stock. He also received $1.14 million in directors\u00d5 fees and stock grants during the six years he was a director at Countrywide. He made more than $5 million from Countrywide stock options, money he says he plowed into his company.\n\nHe says his development work provides an annual income of \u00d2several hundred thousand\u00d3 dollars. All told, his paydays are modest relative to the windfalls some executives netted in the boom. Indeed, Mr. Cisneros says his mistake was not the greed that afflicted many of his counterparts in banking and housing; it was unwavering belief.\n\nIt was, he argues, impossible to know in the beginning that the federal push to increase homeownership would end so badly. Once the housing boom got going, he suggests, laws and regulations barely had a chance.\n\n\u00d2You think you have a finely tuned instrument that you can use to say: \u00d4Stop! We\u00d5re at 69 percent homeownership. We should not go further. There are people who should remain renters,\u00d5 \u00d3 he says. \u00d2But you really are just given a sledgehammer and an ax. They are blunt tools.\u00d3\n\nFrom people dizzily drawing home equity loans out of increasingly valuable houses to banks racking up huge fees, few wanted the party to end.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5m not sure you can regulate when we\u00d5re talking about an entire nation of 300 million people and this behavior becomes viral,\u00d3 Mr. Cisneros says.\n\nHomeownership has deep roots in the American soul. But until recently getting a mortgage was a challenge for low-income families. Many of these families were minorities, which naturally made the subject of special interest to Mr. Cisneros, who, in 1993, became the first Hispanic head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nHe had President Clinton\u00d5s ear, an easy charisma and a determination to increase a homeownership rate that had been stagnant for nearly three decades.\n\nThus was born the National Homeownership Strategy, which promoted ownership as patriotic and an easy win for all. \u00d2We were trying to be creative,\u00d3 Mr. Cisneros recalls."}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "A year after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac teetered, industry executives and Washington policy makers are worrying that another government mortgage giant could be the next housing domino.\n\n\nThis series examines the battles taking place to reshape the financial industry.\n\n\nProblems at the Federal Housing Administration, which guarantees mortgages with low down payments, are becoming so acute that some experts warn the agency might need a federal bailout.\n\nRunning questions about the F.H.A.\u00d5s future \u00d1 underscored by interviews with policy makers, analysts and home buyers \u00d1 came to the fore on Thursday on Capitol Hill. In testimony before a House subcommittee, the F.H.A. commissioner, David H. Stevens, assured lawmakers that his agency would not need a bailout and that it was managing its risks.\n\nBut he acknowledged that some 20 percent of F.H.A. loans insured last year \u00d1 and as many as 24 percent of those from 2007 \u00d1 faced serious problems including foreclosure, offering a preview of a forthcoming audit of the agency\u00d5s finances.\n\n\u00d2Let me simply state at the outset that based on current projections, absent any catastrophic home price decline, F.H.A. will not need to ask Congress and the American taxpayer for extraordinary assistance \u00d1 we will not need a bailout,\u00d3 Mr. Stevens said in his testimony.\n\nBut to its critics, the F.H.A. looks like another Fannie Mae. The hearings on Thursday came on the same day that the federal agency charged with overseeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provided a somber assessment of those giants\u00d5 health. In the year since the government stepped in to rescue them, the companies have taken $96 billion from the Treasury, and may need more.\n\nSince the bottom fell out of the mortgage market, the F.H.A. has assumed a crucial role in the nation\u00d5s housing market. Created in 1934 to help lower-income and first-time buyers purchase homes, the agency now insures roughly 5.4 million single-family home mortgages, with a combined value of $675 billion.\n\nIn addition, these loans are bundled into mortgage-backed securities and guaranteed through the Government National Mortgage Association, known as Ginnie Mae. That means the taxpayer is responsible for paying investors who own Ginnie Mae bonds when F.H.A.-backed mortgages hit trouble.\n\n\u00d2It appears destined for a taxpayer bailout in the next 24 to 36 months,\u00d3 Edward Pinto, a former Fannie Mae executive, said in testimony prepared for the hearing. Mr. Pinto, who was the chief credit officer from 1987 to 1989 for Fannie Mae, went further than most housing analysts and predicted that F.H.A. losses would more than wipe out the agency\u00d5s $30 billion of cash reserves.\n\nThe issue has polarized Congress. Republicans, who led efforts to rein in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before those companies ran into trouble, are now seeking to bridle the F.H.A. Many Democrats insist the F.H.A. is playing a vital role in the housing market, which is only just starting to stabilize.\n\n\u00d2F.H.A. has stepped into the void left by the private market,\u00d3 Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat from California, said at the hearing. \u00d2Let\u00d5s be clear; without F.H.A., there would be no mortgage market right now.\u00d3\n\nThat was the case for Bernadine Shimon. Like many Americans, Ms. Shimon has recently been through some rough times. She lost a house to foreclosure, declared bankruptcy, got divorced and is now a single mother, teaching high school English in a Denver suburb.\n\nShe wanted a house but no lender would touch her. The Federal Housing Administration was more obliging. With the F.H.A. insuring her mortgage, Ms. Shimon was able to buy a $134,000 fixer-upper in August.\n\n\u00d2The government gave me another chance,\u00d3 she said.\n\nThe government is giving as many people as it possibly can the chance to buy a house or, if they are in financial difficulty, refinance it. The F.H.A. is insuring about 6,000 loans a day, four times the amount in 2006. Its portfolio is growing so fast that even F.H.A. backers express amazement.\n\nFor decades it was an article of faith that helping people of limited means like Ms. Shimon get a house was good for the new owner, good for the neighborhood and good for American capitalism. Then came the housing bust, which demonstrated that when lenders allowed people to buy houses they ultimately could not afford, it hurt the parties \u00d1 while putting the economy itself in a tailspin.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crash, there is wide divergence on how easy, or how hard, it should be to become a homeowner. Skittish lenders are asking for 20 percent down, which few prospective borrowers have to spare. As a result, private lending has dwindled."}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "A few years ago, an industry whose history and mythology were indelible parts of the U.S. identity was dying. The great steel mills of Pennsylvania and the Midwest had literally built the United States, but the twin burdens of competition and self-inflicted wounds had brought them to the edge of extinction.\n\nIf they were allowed to go under, their partisans warned, the consequences would ripple through the economy at a cost too high to bear. The old saying, \"As steel goes, so goes the nation,\" was as much a threat as a boast.\n\nThe Detroit automakers are using the same argument as they seek a $25 billion bailout from Congress. \"What happens in the automotive industry affects each and every one of us,\" a General Motors Web site declares, warning that the consequences of a shutdown would be \"devastating.\"\n\nYet steel's savior was not the government bailouts it ardently sought but exactly what it tried so long to avoid: bankruptcy. Only when the companies failed were they successfully slimmed down and retooled into smaller but profitable ventures. As debate continues over what, if anything, should be done for GM, Ford and Chrysler, the steel industry may offer a model.\n\nThe steel and auto industries are both capital-intensive enterprises that peaked a half-century ago and have been intermittently embattled ever since. Both secured peace with their unions by vastly expanding benefits, a bargain that eventually hobbled them. Both had entrenched layers of management that believed - despite all evidence - they could wish away change.\n\nThere are also key differences. Steel is essentially a straightforward commodity industry: The companies compete on price. Auto sales are often ruled by consumer perceptions. This has been a problem for Detroit. Many of its customers long ago fled for Toyota and Honda, and a bankruptcy would scare away many more.\n\nThe steel industry was beginning its long stumble when it turned to Washington for help in the late 1970s. The Carter administration responded by committing $300 million in loan guarantees to five struggling companies. Nearly a third of the funds went to help Wisconsin Steel, a Chicago outfit that had been around since the 1870s.\n\nThanks to a strike at a key customer, Wisconsin Steel promptly went under. The company locked its gates one winter day without even bothering to notify its 3,000 employees that their wages were history.\n\nSo was most of the government's money.\n\nDespite this fiasco, Jimmy Carter's successors tried to deliver on demands for relief. In 1984, Ronald Reagan imposed import quotas to stem the tide of cheap foreign steel. In 1999, Bill Clinton guaranteed $1 billion in loans to beleaguered producers, and the following year imposed punitive tariffs on some imports.\n\nIt was never enough, particularly after the rise of low-cost mini-mills. By late 2001, their industry reeling, the steel makers wanted more from Washington: further protection from imports, pressure on other countries to reduce their steel-making capacity, and billions of taxpayer dollars to relieve the burden of their employees' retirement costs.\n\nThey got a temporary tariff from President George W. Bush, but not much more. And so the steel industry - what was left of it - shuddered and collapsed.\n\nBethlehem Steel, whose steel was used in Hoover Dam, the Chrysler Building and the George Washington Bridge, filed for bankruptcy in October 2001. It was followed by National Steel, Weirton Steel, Georgetown Steel and many others. The pain was great.\n\nAnd necessary, some say. \"If the steel companies had gotten all they wanted in terms of loan guarantees and import quotas, they would never have gotten better,\" said Richard Fruehan, director of the Sloan Study on Competitiveness in the Steel Industry. \"The bankruptcies forced their hand.\"\n\nOver the decades, the companies had shed employees to stay afloat. Soon, retirees greatly outnumbered the actual workers. At Bethlehem, the ratio was six retirees for every worker. All these retirees had good pensions and good health care plans, which they thought were guaranteed. But these costs were a tremendous weight on the companies."}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "The foreclosure crisis is hitting yet another American locale: the self-storage center.\n\nBrook Snyder runs Blair Auction\u00d5s operation in Chicago.\n\nAs they lose their homes, people are turning to these humble cinderblock and sheet-metal boxes to store their stuff. But some people cannot keep up with their storage bills any better than they could handle their mortgage payments, and storage companies are auctioning off their property for a pittance.\n\nA cottage industry has developed to profit from these lost and abandoned items. The other day in this Chicago suburb, Stephanie Donahou and her son Marcus had only a moment to decide whether to bid on a unit in default. They could see a couch, a sewing machine, a fish tank, a washer and dryer, lots of Christmas wrapping paper, a television and other trappings of daily life.\n\n\u00d2This is someone\u00d5s house,\u00d3 Mrs. Donahou said. Her bid, for $160, was the highest. Mr. Donahou was not impressed. \u00d2Ma, you bought a junker,\u00d3 he said, rooting through the material. They began to fill their U-Haul. Good material they would auction on eBay; middling stuff would go to yard sales.\n\nThe auctioneer, Blair Auction & Appraisal, has been conducting sales at self-storage facilities in the Midwest for more than a decade. \u00d2If a site used to have 10 auctions, these days it has 15 or 20,\u00d3 said Wayne Blair, the owner. At one site in Detroit, he auctioned off the contents of 45 units.\n\nSubprime mortgage loans had low \u00d2teaser\u00d3 rates to lure borrowers. Many storage facilities offer the first month for free.\n\n\u00d2You tell yourself, \u00d4I\u00d5m only going to put my things in for a short time,\u00d5 \u00d3 Mr. Blair said. \u00d2Before you know it, you\u00d5re behind. Then you have to pay penalties and interest. You owe $400 to $500. If you lost your job, you can\u00d5t come up with that, not if you want to feed your family.\u00d3\n\nNearly non-existent 35 years ago, self-storage has become ubiquitous, with 51,000 facilities nationwide. Even as the larger economy falters, the industry is flourishing. Executives say the mortgage crisis is one reason.\n\nDean Jernigan, chief executive of the U-Store-It chain, says people generally rely on storage when they are dealing with major milestones: marriage or divorce, a relative\u00d5s death, a job transfer or, in boom times, remodeling or building new homes.\n\nNow he\u00d5s adding foreclosure to the list. \u00d2People are moving back down the property ladder,\u00d3 Mr. Jernigan said.\n\nBill Martin, a 50-year-old former manager in the technology industry, lost his house in the Southern California community of Lake Forest last August. His local self-storage company sent a truck and driver to pick up his things, a service it offers all new customers.\n\n\u00d2Storage has my hopes in it,\u00d3 said Mr. Martin, who sleeps on a foldout bed in his mother\u00d5s guest room. \u00d2I don\u00d5t tell anyone this, but at least once a week I go over and look at my couch, my refrigerator, my TV stand, my mattress and realize I did have a life, and maybe there\u00d5s a way to go back to it.\u00d3\n\nInvestors agree that hard times for homeowners like Mr. Martin will yield good times for storage firms. U-Store-It\u00d5s stock is up 33 percent this year. Extra Space is up 18 percent. Public Storage is up 18 percent.\n\n\u00d2People might lose their home but they\u00d5re not going to lose their things,\u00d3 said Charles Ray Wilson of Self Storage Data Services, a research firm.\n\nYet some evidence suggests that is exactly what is happening. It is impossible to put precise numbers on the phenomenon, partly because the industry is highly fragmented \u00d1 the majority of facilities are locally owned \u00d1 and also because the topic is not one the industry cares to dwell on. But auctioneers who dispose of units in default, as well as the bidders who try to buy their contents, say they see increasing signs of strain. They note that more auctions involve people who appear to have had their homes foreclosed.\n\nFred Reger, an auctioneer in Washington and its suburbs, is seeing two trends, which he calls \u00d2matching luggage\u00d3 and \u00d2residential units.\u00d3\n\nThe first means that he often sees a bunch of over-stuffed plastic bags when he opens a unit. \u00d2People used to put their belongings in boxes,\u00d3 Mr. Reger said. \u00d2But Hefties are a lot cheaper. These people came in under stress, which explains why they defaulted a few months later.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "In a year when global harvests need to be excellent to ease the threat of pervasive food shortages, evidence is mounting that they will be average at best. Some farmers are starting to fear disaster.\n\nAmerican corn and soybean farmers are suffering from too much rain, while Australian wheat farmers have been plagued by drought.\n\n\"The planting has gotten off to a poor start,\" said Bill Nelson, a grains analyst for Wachovia. \"The anxiety level is increasing.\"\n\nRandy Kron, whose family has been farming in the southwestern corner of Indiana for 135 years, should have corn more than 12 inches, or 30 centimeters, tall by now. But all spring, it seemed like there was a faucet in the sky. The rain was regular, remorseless.\n\nSome of Kron's fields are too soggy to plant. Some of the corn he managed to get in has drowned, requiring him to replant. The seeds that survived have produced plants that were barely two inches high.\n\nAt a moment when corn should be flourishing in the United States, 1 plant in 10 has not even emerged from the ground, the U.S. Agriculture Department said Monday. Because corn planted late is more sensitive to heat damage in high summer, every day of delay practically guarantees a lower yield at harvest.\n\n\"This is pushing my nerves to the limit,\" Kron said one recent morning, the sky as dark as the unplanted earth.\n\nLast winter, as the scope of the global food crisis became clearer, commodity prices doubled or tripled, provoking grumbling in the United States, riots in two dozen countries and the specter of greatly increased malnutrition.\n\nAs the world clamors for more corn, wheat, soybeans and rice, farmers are trying to meet the challenge. Millions of acres are coming back into production in Europe. In Asia, planting two or three crops in a single year is becoming more common.\n\nAmerican farmers are planting 324 million acres, or 131 million hectares, this year, up 4 million acres from 2007. Too much of the best land is waterlogged, however. Indiana and Illinois have been hit the worst, and Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota were inundated with rains last weekend.\n\nBob Biehl, whose farm is near St. Louis, Missouri, has managed to plant only 140 of the 650 acres he wanted to devote to corn. Some farmers in his area \"haven't even been able to take the tractor out of the shed,\" he said.\n\nU.S. soybean plantings are running 16 percent behind last year. Rice is tardy in Arkansas, which produces nearly half the country's crop.\n\n\"We're certainly not going to have as good a crop as we had hoped,\" said Harvey Howington of the Arkansas Rice Growers Association. \"I don't think this is good news for anybody.\"\n\nHarvests ebb and flow, of course. But with supplies of most of the key commodities at their lowest levels in decades, there is little room for error this year. American farmers are among the world's top producers, supplying 60 percent of the corn that moves across international borders in a typical year, as well as a third of the soybeans, a quarter of the wheat and a tenth of the rice.\n\n\"If we have bad crops, it's going to be a wild ride,\" said Joseph Glauber, the chief economist of the USDA. \"There's just no cushion.\"\n\nAs every farmer knows, trouble can come at any point before the harvest is complete. Danny and Karen Smith get up in the middle of the night at their wheat farm in Milton, Kansas, whenever they hear thunder.\n\nIn a few weeks, the wheat they planted last fall will be ripe. A bad storm or, worse, a tornado could destroy it. Last year, the Smiths lost nearly all their wheat to a late freeze compounded by too much rain.\n\nThis year, the weather has been perfect: cool and moist. \"See how plump these berries are?\" Smith said, standing in the middle of one of his golden fields. \"This will feed a lot of people.\"\n\nThe world wheat harvest is forecast to rise more than 8 percent this year, thanks to better weather and more acreage under cultivation. But even this bright spot is tentative. Australia was expected to emerge from a two-year drought, but that prediction is looking somewhat doubtful."}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "Boat owners are abandoning ship.\n\nGary Santos, a Mount Pleasant, S.C., councilman, checks a state notice on a forsaken sailboat.\n\nThey often sandpaper over the names and file off the registry numbers, doing their best to render the boats, and themselves, untraceable. Then they casually ditch the vessels in the middle of busy harbors, beach them at low tide on the banks of creeks or occasionally scuttle them outright.\n\nThe bad economy is creating a flotilla of forsaken boats. While there is no national census of abandoned boats, officials in coastal states are worried the problem will only grow worse as unemployment and financial stress continue to rise. Several states are even drafting laws against derelicts and say they are aggressively starting to pursue delinquent owners.\n\n\u00d2Our waters have become dumping grounds,\u00d3 said Maj. Paul R. Ouellette of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. \u00d2It\u00d5s got to the point where something has to be done.\u00d3\n\nDerelict boats are environmental and navigational hazards, leaking toxins and posing obstacles for other craft, especially at night. Thieves plunder them for scrap metal. In a storm, these runabouts and sailboats, cruisers and houseboats can break free or break up, causing havoc.\n\nSome of those disposing of their boats are in the same bind as overstretched homeowners: they face steep payments on an asset that is diminishing in value and decide not to continue. They either default on the debt or take bolder measures.\n\nMarina and maritime officials around the country say they believe, however, that most of the abandoned vessels cluttering their waters are fully paid for. They are expensive-to-maintain toys that have lost their appeal.\n\nThe owners cannot sell them, because the secondhand market is overwhelmed. They cannot afford to spend hundreds of dollars a month mooring and maintaining them. And they do not have the thousands of dollars required to properly dispose of them.\n\nWhen Brian A. Lewis of Seattle tried to sell his boat, Jubilee, no one would pay his asking price of $28,500. Mr. Lewis told the police that maintaining the boat caused \u00d2extreme anxiety,\u00d3 which led him to him drill a two-inch hole in Jubilee\u00d5s hull last March.\n\nThe boat sank in Puget Sound, and Mr. Lewis told his insurance company it was an accident. His scheme came undone when the state, seeking to prevent environmental damage, raised Jubilee. Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty last week to insurance fraud.\n\nWhile there are no reliable national statistics on boating fraud, Todd Schwede, an insurance investigator in San Diego, said the number of suspicious cases he was handling had roughly tripled in the last year, to around 70.\n\nIn many cases, he said, the boater is following this logic: \u00d2I am overinsured on this boat. If I make it go away so no one will find it, the insurance company will give me enough to cover the debt and I\u00d5ll make something on the deal as well.\u00d3\n\nLt. David Dipre, who coordinates Florida\u00d5s derelict vessel program, said the handful of owners he had managed to track down were guilty more of negligence than fraud. \u00d2They say, \u00d4I had a dream of sailing around the world, I just never got around to it.\u00d5 Then they have some bad times and they leave it to someone else to clean up the mess,\u00d3 Lieutenant Dipre said.\n\nFlorida officials say they are moving more aggressively to track down owners and are also starting to unclog the local inlets, harbors, swamps and rivers. The state appropriated funds to remove 118 derelicts this summer, up from only a handful last year.\n\nIn South Carolina, four government investigators started canvassing the state\u00d5s waterways in January. They quickly identified 150 likely derelicts.\n\n\u00d2There are a lot more than we thought there would be,\u00d3 said Lt. Robert McCullough of the state Department of Natural Resources. \u00d2There were a few boats that have always been there, and now all of a sudden they\u00d5ve added up and added up.\u00d3\n\nIn January, it became illegal in South Carolina to abandon a boat on a public waterway. Violators can be fined $5,000 and jailed for 30 days.\n\n\u00d2We never needed a law before,\u00d3 said Gary Santos, a Mount Pleasant councilman.\n"}

After calling a nonprofit housing assistance center, Ms. Koy learned that her mortgage, for all the trouble it was causing her, was not likely to be one of those qualifying for relief.\n\nMortgage experts say there will be many borrowers like Ms. Koy. The exact guidelines of the rescue plan are still fuzzy, but it is clear that many of those who need aid the most will not get it. The number of households facing foreclosure in the next two years is estimated to exceed two million.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5m glad someone\u00d5s getting help, but I wish it were me,\u00d3 said Ms. Koy, 46, who works in the state unemployment office.\n\nShe has a so-called option loan, which gives her the choice of how much to pay every month. Heavy in debt, she usually chooses the minimum. The unpaid interest and principal is added to her mortgage balance, which means her loan keeps getting bigger.\n\nMs. Koy\u00d5s woes were compounded by an ill-advised refinancing two years ago.\n\n\u00d2I got all these calls from brokers all the time \u00d1 \u00d4You could pay off debt, pay off the car loan, make extra money every month, blah blah,\u00d5 \u00d3 she said. She took out $60,000.\n\n\u00d2The only way that would have made sense is if I had cut up my credit cards and nothing else had come up,\u00d3 Ms. Koy said. \u00d2But something else always comes up.\u00d3\n\nMs. Koy\u00d5s husband is disabled and has not worked for a decade. The couple\u00d5s credit card debt is back up to $25,000, in part because of their daughter\u00d5s medical bills. Their three-bedroom house is worth about $250,000, but they owe much more on it.\n\nKimberley Williams, who owns a small bungalow in Los Angeles, might have a happier fate than Ms. Koy. She bought her home in February 2006, as the boom was peaking.\n\n\u00d2I felt that if I didn\u00d5t get into the market, I wouldn\u00d5t be able to afford a house in California,\u00d3 she said.\n\nIn November 2006, Ms. Williams refinanced. Like Ms. Koy, she got money to pay bills, including paying off her car. But her monthly mortgage payment rose to $3,011. Next December, it will jump by several hundred dollars.\n\nMs. Williams, a registered nurse, does not regret refinancing, but is worried about possibly being forced to sell in a declining market \u00d1 or worse.\n\n\u00d2Even people with good jobs making good money are facing foreclosure,\u00d3 said Ms. Williams, 43. She plans to apply for the freeze.\n\nWhile acknowledging that only a small number of stressed borrowers would be helped, Lori Gay, president of Los Angeles Neighborhood Housing Services, a nonprofit group, called the freeze \u00d2a great beginning.\u00d3\n\nMichael Shea, executive director of Acorn Housing, another counseling agency, took a different view. \u00d2We\u00d5re disappointed that a year into this crisis the responses are so lacking in the bold leadership,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2We really need an F.D.R.-like approach, and not Calvin Coolidge.\u00d3\n\nReal estate agents in high-foreclosure areas had different opinions about whether the freeze would have an effect on queasy markets.\n\nJason Bosch, president of Home Center Realty in California\u00d5s hard-hit Riverside County, was pessimistic.\n\n\u00d2We were selling $300,000 homes to people who could only afford $175,000 homes,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2Even if you freeze their payments, they still can\u00d5t handle it.\u00d3\n\nIn Sarasota, Fla., a real estate agent, Jim Willig, was hopeful that at least the freeze would put a brake on some of the inventory flooding the area.\n\n\u00d2That\u00d5s a benefit,\u00d3 said Mr. Willig, who owns seven rental houses, all of them worth less than he paid.\n\nTom Gutierrez, bought his house in 2004, too early to qualify for the freeze.\n\nMr. Gutierrez, a school bus driver who lives in West Covina, Calif., is negotiating a new loan. \u00d2Many home buyers didn\u00d5t do our homework,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2Maybe some kind of education will help as well.\u00d3 "}
{"klass": "david_streitfeld", "text": "This should be a triumphant time for the debt settlement industry. If ever there was a moment when masses of people needed help so they were not smothered by the weight of their credit card bills, it is now.\n\nBut at a conclave of settlement professionals here this week, the mood was more of crisis than celebration. One sober question hung in the air: Would the industry exist in anything like its present form in a few years?\n\nA formidable array of forces is concerned about the way the settlement companies solicit consumers and negotiate lower payments on their debts. The industry is in the cross hairs of the Federal Trade Commission, state regulators, members of Congress and state legislatures. Credit card companies are not fond of it, and many consumer advocates practically loathe it.\n\nThe common complaint among all these groups is that too many debt settlement companies are more interested in helping themselves earn fees than aiding their beleaguered clients. Their ads promise the clients will get out of debt but, critics say, the reality is that they often become even more enmeshed.\n\nNoting \u00d2the legal firestorm that has subsumed the debt settlement industry\u00d3 in recent years, Jeffrey Tenenbaum, a lawyer representing dozens of settlement firms, warned that many companies could be \u00d2legislated, regulated or litigated out of business.\u00d3 Like the other speakers, he stood on a conference stage outfitted as a boxing ring.\n\nSome attendees confronted the prospect of new laws with foreboding. \u00d2I think regulation is going to be a killer,\u00d3 said David Fishman of Arbitronix, based in Las Vegas.\n\nBut others saw it as good news. \u00d2There\u00d5s a lot of bad apples in this industry,\u00d3 said David Jenkins of First American Debt Relief in Newport Beach, Calif. \u00d2Let\u00d5s clean it up.\u00d3\n\nA third group said it was all a problem of miscommunication.\n\nRegulators and attorneys general \u00d2don\u00d5t understand what we do and how we do it, and the benefits we provide for consumers,\u00d3 said Peter McLaughlin of Preferred Financial Services in Andover, Mass.\n\nUnderstanding might be on the upswing, although whether it will lead to appreciation is a separate issue. Preferred Financial was one of numerous settlement companies that received a subpoena from the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, last month as part of a wide-ranging investigation.\n\nThe settlement companies, which number about 2,000, have varying business models but generally develop programs for strapped individuals to pay off a percentage of their credit card debt and avoid bankruptcy.\n\nOnly a handful of the companies came to this convention, which was run by a trade group called the United States Organizations for Bankruptcy Alternatives. Participants stressed that that it was the people who were not there who were the problem.\n\n\u00d2The bottom feeders are ruining our reputation,\u00d3 said John Ansbach, the general counsel for EFA Processing in Frisco, Tex. \u00d2The good stories are not being told.\u00d3\n\nPart of the problem with industry, Mr. Ansbach said, is that there are few barriers to entry. Many of the smaller firms are virtual outfits, contracting with outsourcing companies to do all the back-end work of talking to the debtors, enrolling them and negotiating settlements.\n\nEFA itself is one of these outsourcers, handling settlement programs for dozens of corporate clients. Mr. Ansbach says EFA rejects more new clients than it takes on.\n\nThere are even companies to help secure the customers. Max Bruck is the vice president of sales for Find Your Customers Inc., which develops print, radio and television spots. The most successful ads, he said, emphasize words like \u00d2stress\u00d3 and \u00d2anxiety\u00d3 and showcase notions like the inability to sleep or frequent fights with a spouse..\n\nMr. Bruck has just finished a radio ad that begins with an employer calling a job applicant, ominously wondering why the job-seeker went bankrupt. \u00d2Bankruptcy stays with you forever,\u00d3 the announcer warns.\n\nListeners\u00d5 calls are funneled to clients of Mr. Bruck who pay $80 each. The average ad generates 500 to 1,000 calls, he said.\n"}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "The Democratic chairman of a House investigative committee presented documents to the Pentagon on Thursday charging that a top Republican fund-raiser, Harry Sargeant III, made tens of millions of dollars in profits over the last four years because his contracting company vastly overcharged for deliveries of fuel to American air bases in Iraq.\n\n\nHarry Sargeant III is the finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party.\n\nIn a written statement on Thursday, a lawyer for Mr. Sargeant, who is the finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party and a major fund-raiser for Senator John McCain\u00d5s presidential campaign, called the allegations \u00d2deeply disappointing\u00d3 and asserted that they were not supported by the facts.\n\nThe contracting company, called the International Oil Trading Company, or I.O.T.C., was briefly in the news over the summer when a former partner filed a lawsuit against Mr. Sargeant in a Florida circuit court.\n\nThe former partner, a Jordanian named Mohammad al-Saleh, is a brother-in-law of King Abdullah II of Jordan. The court papers laid out his assertion that he obtained special governmental authorizations for the company to transport the fuel through Jordan and was then unlawfully forced out by Mr. Sargeant, who strongly disputed those allegations.\n\nBut the latest claims of impropriety by the company, presented by Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, in a letter to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, go much further. Mr. Waxman uses e-mail messages, company documents, Pentagon reports and other information to make the case that Mr. Sargeant repeatedly received contracts to deliver the fuel even though his company was not the lowest bidder.\n\nIn one case, the letter from Mr. Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, asserts that Mr. Sargeant\u00d5s company submitted the highest of six bids, but received the contract anyway. In fact, Pentagon contracting officers complained that the company\u00d5s prices were unreasonably high and initially said they could not justify giving the work to Mr. Sargeant.\n\nBut for reasons the company was never able to explain, Mr. Waxman\u00d5s letter indicates, no other American company was given an authorization to transport the fuel through Jordan. And when the United States Central Command declared that the need for the fuel was urgent, the Pentagon was forced to award the contract to Mr. Sargeant\u00d5s company.\n\nNothing in the documents Mr. Waxman\u00d5s staff assembled indicated that there was any attempt by Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, or his staff to influence the granting of the contracts.\n\nAccording to the documents, the Pentagon tried to negotiate a lower price with Mr. Sargeant, but he held firm, saying the prices were reasonable given his expenses. But as a result, Mr. Waxman\u00d5s letter says, the company has been paid $1.4 billion on four different contracts for the fuel deliveries and made a profit of $210 million after expenses.\n\nThe letter and other documents indicate that Mr. Sargeant currently has just one other partner in the venture, suggesting that they would largely divide those profits. \u00d2Mr. Sargeant\u00d5s personal gain from these four contracts may have been $70 million or higher,\u00d3 Mr. Waxman\u00d5s letter says.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Gates, Chris Isleib, said that the Pentagon had supplied all the documents that Mr. Waxman had requested in the case. \u00d2As a result of these documents and subsequent discussions with the committee, Congressman Waxman asked the secretary of defense to investigate allegations that I.O.T.C. has overcharged for the delivery of fuel,\u00d3 Mr. Isleib said in an e-mail message. The Pentagon will respond directly to the committee on that request, Mr. Isleib said.\n\nJim Greer, the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, said, \u00d2Since Harry Sargeant has been the finance chairman, he has always demonstrated the highest degree of ethics and integrity and has always served the party well.\u00d3\n\nBrian Rogers, a spokesman for the McCain campaign, said: \u00d2This obviously has nothing do with the McCain campaign. John McCain has always called for full transparency in military contracting, and if there\u00d5s a nonpolitical mechanism for looking at credible allegations, then that should obviously go forward.\u00d3\n\nRyan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense in Washington, said that further investigation was warranted even though the initial inquiry did not turn up direct evidence of political meddling. Mr. Waxman estimated that if the lowest bidder had been awarded the contracts, taxpayers would have saved some $180 million.\n\n\u00d2The fact that the contracting officer warned them lends credence to the general allegation that this is profiteering and that this is an unfair contract,\u00d3 Ms. Alexander said. \u00d2To allow that high of a profit to deliver fuel to the troops is not the kind of management we need right now.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "Our guide, an acerbic Belizean named Albert, walked us up a hill, around a bend in the path and toward the weathered stone ziggurat and weedy surrounding structures that rose out of the jungle like a real estate development gone bad.\n\nThe Maya put humans in line with the heavens with a pyramid; physicists try to unlock the universe\u00d5s secrets with a particle collider.\n\nIt was Xunantunich, the sacred Mayan pyramid carefully aligned with the sun, moon and stars and built layer upon layer over hundreds of years by successive generations until something went wrong \u00d1 nobody knows exactly what \u00d1 and the inhabitants simply left. I am not sure what most visitors think when they behold that crumbling majesty and mystery. As a former physicist, I thought of the Large Hadron Collider, another grandiose structure with cosmic aspirations and earthbound problems that could thwart its ambitions.\n\nThe collider, a giant machine outside Geneva that is hunting for subatomic particles that could help explain the origin of the universe, was already idle and behind schedule during the recent visit to Belize. And last week, the laboratory where the accelerator is located announced that when it finally starts smashing particles together this winter, it will run at only half power because of a disastrous electrical short that caused extensive damage and revealed problems with the experiment itself.\n\nOn the hill in Belize, we were sweating from the climb and distracted by Albert, who was squinting with his one good eye and poking a stick into a tarantula\u00d5s hole to entertain a family from Oklahoma. But standing before the ruin, I had at least a hint of the thought that gripped me with full force last week: In Xunantunich and now again in Switzerland, the vast reaches of cosmic time and space have a way of humbling the puny efforts and resources of mortals who try to figure out the universe.\n\nIt may have been the local rum punches, but to me the similarities between the two projects were clear-cut. The collider is a gargantuan structure at the European Center for Nuclear Research, called CERN, that scientists have built over generations to help them connect the smallest and largest structures in the universe, and perhaps make sense of why the cosmos is so hospitable to life.\n\nSans particles, Xunantunich was designed to do more or less the same thing in the Central American hills. Instead of quarks and leptons, the friezes ringing the pyramid depict the gods of heaven, earth and the underworld, and humanity\u00d5s place among them. The stone structures themselves were laid out according to careful astronomical observations to help priests, rulers and common folk alike organize their lives and accurately mark the passing of time.\n\nAnd like Xunantunich, the collider these days is silent, if not abandoned. After $9 billion and 15 years in just the latest phase of CERN\u00d5s life, the collider \u00d1 a multinational collaboration that includes the United States \u00d1 has been idled by an electrical short involving its colossal magnets, leading some frustrated scientists to ask whether it will ever fulfill the dreams, and justify the money, that have been invested in it.\n\nMany other scientists ardently believe that it would be an injustice if the collider, built in an underground ring 16 miles in circumference, were threatened by delays that are minuscule in comparison to the lifetime of the cosmos, which the experiment seeks in large measure to explain.\n\n\u00d2I don\u00d5t see it in quite those apocalyptic terms,\u00d3 said Steven Weinberg, the Nobel Prize-winning particle theorist, who said he visited CERN just a few days ago and saw no signs of a Maya-style pullout. \u00d2Everyone there was unhappy about the earlier accident, but I didn\u00d5t get the feeling that there was panic or that they were resigned to anything but a delay.\u00d3\n\nStill, Dr. Weinberg was heavily involved in trying to save an earlier project that became a monument to unfulfilled cosmological aspirations \u00d1 the Superconducting Supercollider, now a muddy hole in Texas after problems with its cost and schedule led Congress to withdraw financing in the early 1990s.\n\nAnd scientists watching the latest particle drama concede that as physics experiments get so large that they must be passed from generation to generation and expensive enough that a single country cannot even afford them, it does not take as much to deal a catastrophic blow to a project.\n\n\u00d2When I was doing particle physics back in the \u00d560s, a three-month run was enormous,\u00d3 said Allan Franklin, now a historian of science at the University of Colorado at Boulder. \u00d2You put together the apparatus, you took the data and you analyzed it, and if you weren\u00d5t done in a year it was a failure.\u00d3\n\nNow, with billions of dollars and thousands of scientific careers at stake in the CERN project, Dr. Franklin said, \u00d2if it fails, it\u00d5s almost a disaster for an entire field.\u00d3\n\nEven the Large Hadron Collider has not been around as long as Xunantunich was before the Mayas mysteriously left it behind. The central pyramid, nicknamed El Castillo, was built like a birthday cake in three or four phases over roughly 300 years, starting sometime between A.D. 500 and 600, said Richard M. Leventhal, a professor of anthropology and director of the Cultural Heritage Center at the University of Pennsylvania. He has led many archeological digs at Xunantunich, which is located in the hills of western Belize near the border with Guatemala.\n\nScientists have variously proposed that earthquakes, hurricanes, drought, malaria and yellow fever led the Mayas to abandon Xunantunich. But Dr. Leventhal said he believed such explanations were beside the point.\n\nWhat happens first, he says, is that a worldview or belief system underpinning a culture begins to weaken. Only then can some unfortunate event like a natural disaster, or an electrical short, threaten the whole system.\n\n\u00d2All of these multigenerational projects are based upon a strong and ongoing belief system in how the world works,\u00d3 Dr. Leventhal said. As long as that system stays intact, he said, \u00d2construction continues and is slightly modified within each generation to fit the current time.\u00d3 If not, all bets are off.\n\nIn particle physics, that system is uninspiringly called the Standard Model, which accounts for all known matter but has one gap: the elusive Higgs boson. Physicists at the collider say they hope to capture that particle, which supposedly explains the origin of mass, and perhaps a few other particles that could point to an extension of the model.\n\nFor his part, Albert, who appeared to be very well read on the topic, took a hard line on the disappearance of the Mayas at Xunantunich, asserting that they were forced to leave solely because they failed to rotate their crops.\n\n\u00d2There was no food,\u00d3 said Albert, who said that he had some Maya blood on his mother\u00d5s side.\n\nWhatever the true cause of the Maya exodus, a CERN spokesman, James Gillies, said that he did not expect the laboratory to suffer a similar fate any time soon. Mr. Gillies added that if, in some very distant future, visitors gazed on his laboratory\u00d5s ruins as I did on those at Xunantunich, there would probably be far fewer mysteries to ponder.\n\n\u00d2I sincerely hope that if the human race has managed to survive that long,\u00d3 Mr. Gillies said, \u00d2we will have left a big enough imprint on science that people will not have to speculate on what the priesthood of CERN was up to.\u00d3"}

Marburger III, President Bush's science adviser, might relish a dose of that obscurity right now. Instead, he has become the first line of defense against accusations that the Bush administration has systematically distorted scientific fact and stacked technical advisory committees to advance favored policies on the environment, on biomedical research and on other areas like the search for unconventional weapons in Iraq.\n\nDr. Marburger says that pattern is illusory, a product of stringing together a few unrelated incidents within the vast canvas of government science, most of which is working just fine.\n\n\"From all the evidence I can find,\" he said, \"it's certainly not true that science is being manipulated by this administration to suit its policy. It's simply not the case.\"\n\nBut to a degree not seen in previous administrations, a wide range of influential scientists ? even many who say they like Dr. Marburger personally and respect him professionally ? express dismay at White House science policy.\n\n\"I think this is as bad as it's ever been,\" said Wolfgang H. K. Panofsky, a retired Stanford physicist who has advised the government on science and national security since the Eisenhower administration. \"This is an extremely serious issue. I believe it is true that there is such a thing as objective scientific reality, and if you ignore that or try to misrepresent it in formulating policy, you do so at peril to the country.\"\n\nOther experts have been blunter. In a recent interview on National Public Radio, Dr. Howard Gardner, a cognitive psychologist at Harvard, said, \"I actually feel very sorry for Marburger, because I think he probably is enough of a scientist to realize that he basically has become a prostitute.\"\n\nLater, in an interview with The New York Times, Dr. Gardner said he had made the reference but added, \"I wish I'd used it as a verb rather than as a noun.\"\n\nAn intent graying physicist and woodworking enthusiast who once built an entire harpsichord from scratch, Dr. Marburger, 63, is so unassuming that he routinely melted into the backdrop at announcements of scientific discoveries while working at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton on Long Island. He was director of the laboratory before moving to Washington in October 2001.\n\nBut just as in the now-you-see-it, now-you-don't world of quantum phenomena that Dr. Marburger, who is also director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House, has spent much of his life studying, appearances may be beside the point. Widely believed to be excluded from the president's inner circle ? he surprised many people by declaring soon after his nomination that he was a lifelong Democrat ? Dr. Marburger is said by White House officials to have Mr. Bush's ear on all important technical matters. The president who is supposedly so antagonistic to science enjoys Dr. Marburger's explanatory style, the officials say.\n\nIn fact, Dr. Marburger, who has recently endured speculation that he might resign, may be just what fellow scientists have always longed for in the White House, an expert with deep knowledge of the technical issues, a bureaucrat's ease in palace politics, a ready turn of phrase and even a modest dose of mystique.\n\n\"He is closer to the pulse in the White House than any of his predecessors, to my knowledge,\" said Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff who also worked for Mr. Bush's father and Ronald Reagan. Not only does Dr. Marburger typically attend each morning meeting for the senior staff in the Roosevelt Room, Mr. Card said, but also \"the president enjoys Jack Marburger.\"\n\n\"He's a little bit of a character, which is fun,\" Mr. Card said.\n\nJoshua B.

{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": " Iraq has agreed to award $1.1 billion in contracts to Iranian and Chinese companies to build a pair of enormous power plants, the Iraqi electricity minister said Tuesday. Word of the project prompted serious concerns among American military officials, who fear that Iranian commercial investments can mask military activities at a time of heightened tension with Iran.\n\nA worker at a power plant in Baghdad on Wednesday. Baghdad and the rest of Iraq still suffer from shortages of electricity.\n\nThe Iraqi electricity minister, Karim Wahid, said that the Iranian project would be built in Sadr City, a Shiite enclave in Baghdad that is controlled by followers of the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr. He added that Iran had also agreed to provide cheap electricity from its own grid to southern Iraq, and to build a large power plant essentially free of charge in an area between the two southern Shiite holy cities of Karbala and Najaf.\n\nThe expansion of ties between Iraq and Iran comes as the United States and Iran clash on nuclear issues and about what American officials have repeatedly said is Iranian support for armed groups in Iraq. American officials have charged that Iranians, through the international military wing known as the Quds Force, are particularly active in support of elite elements of the Mahdi Army, a militia largely controlled by Mr. Sadr.\n\nAn American military official in Baghdad said that while he had no specific knowledge of the power plant contracts, any expansion of Iranian interests was a concern for the military here.\n\n\u00d2We are of course carefully watching Iran\u00d5s overall presence here in Iraq,\u00d3 the military official said. \u00d2As you know, it\u00d5s not always as it appears. Their Quds Force routinely uses the cover of a business to mask their real purpose as an intelligence operative.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2This is a free marketplace, so there\u00d5s not much we can do about it,\u00d3 the official said.\n\nAt the same time, it is possible to view Iranian and Chinese investment as giving those countries a stake in Iraqi stability. The power plants could also boost a troubled reconstruction effort in Iraq. An American Embassy spokesman said, \u00d2We welcome any efforts to help develop Iraq\u00d5s energy infrastructure.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2These proposals reflect the ongoing business opportunities that are arising in Iraq that American firms should be competing for,\u00d3 said the spokesman, who asked not to be named because of standard protocol at the embassy.\n\nIt was unclear whether any American firms had tried to win the work, although Mr. Wahid said the projects had been submitted for bids. The embassy spokesman said, \u00d2We are unaware of any violations of principles of open and fair bidding.\u00d3\n\nThe agreements between Iraq and Iran come after the American-led reconstruction effort, which relied heavily on large American contractors, has spent nearly $5 billion of United States taxpayer money on Iraq\u00d5s electricity grid. Aside from a few isolated bright spots, there was little clear impact in a nation where in many places electricity is still available only for a few hours each day. Because the power plants are in largely Shiite-controlled areas, it is possible they may not face the same sectarian violence that crippled so many American rebuilding projects.\n\nMr. Wahid did not say how much the plant between Karbala and Najaf would cost, but at standard international prices a plant of the scale he described would be worth roughly $200 million to $300 million.\n\nThe outlines of all three agreements were confirmed by Thamir Ghadban, an expert on energy who is also director of the committee of advisers to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. But Mr. Ghadban said that the granting of the huge projects to rivals of the United States was not an indication that American companies were being excluded from consideration now that Iraqi oil revenues, which provide the basis for the Iraqi government\u00d5s budget, are largely paying for the reconstruction of the grid.\n\n\u00d2There is no preference to the Iranians,\u00d3 Mr. Ghadban said, citing the most obvious potential point of sensitivity for the United States. \u00d2There is no opposition or stance from the Iraqi government to bar American or Western companies. It is the other way around,\u00d3 Mr. Ghadban said, indicating that he urged American contractors to bid for work in Iraq.\n\nOf the two new projects Iraq has agreed to finance, Mr. Wahid said, the largest is a $940 million power plant in Wasit to be built by a Chinese company, which he said was named Shanghai Heavy Industry. That project would pump some 1,300 megawatts of electricity into the Iraqi grid. For comparison, all of the plants currently connected to Iraq\u00d5s grid produce a total of roughly 5,000 megawatts.\n\nHe said that Iraq had already spent $12 million leveling the ground in preparation for the Chinese plant. The Sadr City project, which will include a small refinery, will cost $150 million and be built by an Iranian company, Sunir, Mr. Wahid said. That plant is expected to produce about 160 megawatts of electricity."}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "Long before atoms could be detected individually, scientists deduced their existence from the way dust motes danced in droplets of liquid; atoms making up the liquid were colliding with and jostling the dust.\n\nNow, in a possible replay, a physicist is suggesting that minute vibrations caused by a kind of graininess in the structure of space itself can be detected and measured. And he has identified just the instrument to make the measurements, a device built to measure gravity waves.\n\nThe physicist, Dr. Jack Ng, of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, makes his suggestion in a paper to be published on Monday in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nMany physicists have theorized that space is not uniform but instead consists of fluctuating patches, something like ripples or bubbles, smaller than a trillion-trillionth of an ordinary atom. The problem is the patches, often referred to collectively as \"quantum foam,\" are so small that scientists have sometimes despaired of ever testing the theory.\n\nBut Dr. Ng (pronounced ENG) has calculated that the $300 million Laser Interferometer Gravitational- Wave Observatory, or LIGO, which has just begun making measurements at two sites in Washington State and Louisiana, could eventually collect evidence of the foam, yielding new insights into the nature of space. Physicists designed LIGO to look for the smoother, but still nearly imperceptible, distortions of space caused by passing gravity waves.\n\nIn a sense, Dr. Ng theorized, fluctuations from individual patches of space should add together to produce a signal strong enough for LIGO to detect. Any such signal would be readily distinguishable from effects of gravity waves, he said. \"The fluctuations are much bigger than what one would na\u0095vely think,\" he said. \"I am confidently making a bet that quantum foam will be detected.\"\n\nPhysicists are greeting his idea with emotions ranging from excitement to deep skepticism. But most conceded it rests on some well- known ideas in advanced physics ? for example, calculations of the ultimate limits of computing speeds. The maximum amount of information that could be encoded in a given region of space depends on how small the \"bits\" could be ? and they could never be smaller that the grains or patches of space itself. So the ultimate power of computing also depends on that quantum graininess.\n\n\"It's a very pleasing picture,\" said Dr. Seth Lloyd, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"You can apply these ideas about quantum information processing to get some insight into the structure of space-time at really small scales.\"\n\nBut others said there were possible gaps in Dr. Ng's reasoning and that, as a result, the fluctuations he hopes LIGO can measure might be too small to be detected, especially since the device was designed to measure the smooth, rolling perturbations of gravitational waves, not the slight jitters that theories about the foam predict.\n\n\"If we saw what he is predicting, that would be a revolution in the way that you look at space and time,\" said Dr. Rainer Weiss, an M.I.T. physicist working on LIGO. But he said the experimental setup could make them practically undetectable.\n\nDr. William Unruh, a physicist at the University of British Columbia and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, said, \"I find it hard to believe that one could get an effect in LIGO.\"\n\nPhysicists have struggled for decades to find a theory that joins quantum mechanics, which describes the fuzziness of ordinary matter at small scales, and Einstein's theory of relativity, which shows how gravity warps space. Those \"quantum gravity\" theories differ in detail, but many predict that space itself should be fuzzy and fluctuating on unimaginably tiny scales.\n\nDr. Ng's theory says the combined effects of those fluctuations should be detectable. Discovering those fluctuations could guide physicists to the correct quantum gravity theory.\n\nDr. Stuart Shapiro, a physicist at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, compared the theory to surprising predictions just after World War II that fluctuating electric and magnetic fields in apparently empty space could have measurable effects on electrons in atoms ? predictions that were later verified.\n\nEven if the effects are not as large as Dr. Ng predicts, said Dr. Abhay Ashtekar, director of the Center for Gravitational Physics and Geometry at Pennsylvania State University, the calculation offers hope that quantum gravity theories can be checked. \"I think it is very possible that some idea along these lines can actually be tested in the next 10 years or so,\" Dr. Ashtekar said."}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "IT was two months before Sept. 11, 2001, in an Arab country that will remain unnamed, and the Iraqi subject of the interrogation was not talking. So the translator, a 6-foot-5, iron-jawed local man with scars from the wars he had been in, turned to the interrogator.\n\n''Do you want me to soften him up?'' the translator asked.\n\nNo one in the room had any doubt about the import of those words, said Marc Garlasco, an intelligence officer who was present. But instead of continuing with the perfect B-movie script and allowing the stonewalling Iraqi to be beaten up or humiliated, the interrogator blew up.\n\n''Are you nuts?'' he shouted.\n\nAfter calling a break, he asked the translator if he had ever revealed secrets under torture when he had been captured. Never, the translator said. ''Listen,'' the interrogator lectured him. ''Torture doesn't work.''\n\nTorture can make people talk -- but experienced interrogators know that they usually can't tell if what the subject says under torture or humiliation is true, because the subject will say what he or she thinks will end the torture. Novice interrogators are seldom aware of how compromised information gained under duress is likely to be.\n\nIt now seems apparent that after 9/11, scenes like the one in the Arab interrogation room became more rare. Even before the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, at least according to human rights organizations, questionable interrogation practices verging on torture were taking place at bases in Afghanistan and the American detention center at Guant\u0087namo Bay in Cuba.\n\nWhatever the truth of the other allegations, the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib shouts out for an explanation: how could ordinary American soldiers and civilian contractors inflict such degradation on other human beings?\n\nOne answer, say psychologists, former intelligence officers and military analysts, may lie in the nature of torture itself: Torture and humiliation is a landscape without boundaries, a terrible slope that even the most practiced interrogators can slide down once they allow themselves to apply the slightest physical or psychological pressure.\n\nYehezkel Lein, head of the research department at B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization, said that after Israel began curbing the use of physical pressure in the late 1980's, it initially limited its use only to so-called ticking time bombs -- prisoners with knowledge of an imminent attack. But he said that B'Tselem research showed that even under those guidelines, roughly 80 percent of detained Palestinians ended up being subjected to physical techniques like severe sleep deprivation, sitting in painful positions for hours and worse.\n\n''It was impossible to draw a clear line,'' Mr. Lein said. He cited the practice of grabbing a prisoner's shirt and shaking him. He said the shaking sometimes became so violent that several prisoners died.\n\n''You can try to put it onto a continuum,'' said Dr. Rona M. Fields, a psychologist and senior researcher at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies at George Washington University's engineering school.\n\nBut, she added, ''as soon as the person is intimidated, it's torture.''\n\nDr. Fields gave another example of how torture in the wrong hands can quickly spiral out of control and waste lives. After the coup that brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to power in Chile, military interrogators who used ''grotesque and terrible'' torture often killed their subjects before learning anything of value, Dr. Fields said, forcing the country to turn to the better-trained police. Employing methods she said they had learned from C.I.A. and Defense Department manuals, the police were better able to keep their subjects alive until they revealed information, which they sometimes did.\n\nThe debate over what went horribly wrong at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq has oscillated between the assertion that the soldiers and contractors who mistreated prisoners were, in a twisted way, having a good time, and the possibility that they were acting under orders.\n"}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "Two senior members of the Senate Armed Services Committee have requested a full accounting of how Iraq is spending its soaring oil revenue, amid starkly conflicting estimates of how much the country has invested in rebuilding its broken infrastructure and providing basic services to its citizens.\n\nThe request, sent Friday to David M. Walker, the top official at the United States Government Accountability Office, estimates that Iraqi oil revenue could skyrocket above $56 billion in 2008, largely because of the rising price of oil.\n\nThat enormous influx of cash comes as the United States has been reducing spending on the reconstruction effort. Since the invasion in 2003, the United States has invested close to $50 billion in reconstruction, but the effort has achieved at best mixed results when measured by improvements in the lives of Iraqi citizens.\n\nStill, the American military and State Department continue to finance a wide range of relatively small reconstruction projects as well as training and equipment for Iraqi military forces.\n\nDespite the dire need for better health care, more electricity and clean water, a functioning sewage system and other services, the accountability office has previously estimated that Iraq spent only 22 percent of the oil money set aside for reconstruction in 2006. And in January, the office, which is charged with overseeing the Iraqi government\u00d5s finances, reported that Iraq had spent a meager 4.4 percent of its 2007 reconstruction budget by August of that year, the most recent figures available at the time.\n\nAs a result, the letter from the Armed Services Committee says, \u00d2we believe that it has been overwhelmingly U.S. taxpayer money that has funded Iraq reconstruction over the last five years, despite Iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue over that time period that have ended up in non-Iraqi banks.\u00d3\n\nThe letter was signed by Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is the committee chairman, and Senator John W. Warner, a Virginia Republican who is a former chairman. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the ranking Republican on the committee and the presumptive Republican nominee for president, did not sign the letter.\n\nIraqi officials say they face many obstacles in what might seem to be a straightforward task: spending their plentiful money. Workers are attacked, engineers and contracting experts have fled government ministries, construction companies refuse to take jobs in risky areas and building materials are not available.\n\nAnd if all of those factors were not daunting enough, the various Iraqi and American government entities involved cannot even agree on how much the notoriously opaque Iraqi bureaucracy has in fact spent on reconstruction.\n\nLast fall, as Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, and Ryan C. Crocker, the American ambassador to Iraq, reported to Congress on the state of the war, the Bush administration provided figures that contrasted sharply with those of the accountability office. The administration reported that by July 2007, Iraq had spent 24 percent of the $10 billion in oil revenue set aside for reconstruction that year.\n\nThe accountability office disputed those figures, saying they were based in part on projections that proved inaccurate. But in a recent phone interview, a senior Iraqi official gave even more bullish estimates of the expenditures. Citing official Iraqi Finance Ministry figures, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to provide information that had not yet been publicly released, said by the end of last year, Iraq had spent 63 percent of its capital budget, a leap over the previous year that would indicate rapid progress in governmental efficiency.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s totally unacceptable that there\u00d5s no decent accounting for their money,\u00d3 Senator Levin said in a telephone interview Saturday. \u00d2But the problem is our money. Why are we spending our money five years later when they have a surplus? That\u00d5s just extraordinary.\u00d3\n\nIn order to resolve some of these discrepancies and track down where the oil money has gone, the letter by Senators Levin and Warner asks the accountability office to answer a series of basic questions.\n\nThe senators requested detailed information on the amount of Iraqi oil revenue from 2003 to 2007, how much of that money has gone unspent, and \u00d2how much money does the Iraqi government have deposited, in which banks, and in what countries?\u00d3\n\nFinally, Senators Levin and Warner ask the question looming over the entire rebuilding effort: \u00d2Why has the Iraqi government not spent more of its oil revenue on reconstruction, economic development and providing essential services for the Iraqi people?\u00d3\n\nAlso on Friday, Iraqi security forces discovered a mass grave containing the remains of about 100 people in Diyala Province, said Maj. Winfield Danielson, a spokesman for Multinational Forces-Iraq. "}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "Investigations led by a Republican lawyer named Stuart W. Bowen Jr. in Iraq have sent American occupation officials to jail on bribery and conspiracy charges, exposed disastrously poor construction work by well-connected companies like Halliburton and Parsons, and discovered that the military did not properly track hundreds of thousands of weapons it shipped to Iraqi security forces.\n\nMr. Bowen\u00d5s office has inspected and audited taxpayer-financed projects like this prison in Nasiriya, Iraq.\n\nAnd tucked away in a huge military authorization bill that President Bush signed two weeks ago is what some of Mr. Bowen\u00d5s supporters believe is his reward for repeatedly embarrassing the administration: a pink slip.\n\nThe order comes in the form of an obscure provision that terminates his federal oversight agency, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, on Oct. 1, 2007. The clause was inserted by the Republican side of the House Armed Services Committee over the objections of Democratic counterparts during a closed-door conference, and it has generated surprise and some outrage among lawmakers who say they had no idea it was in the final legislation.\n\nMr. Bowen\u00d5s office, which began operation in January 2004 to examine reconstruction money spent in Iraq, was always envisioned as a temporary organization, permitted to continue its work only as long as Congress saw fit. Some advocates for the office, in fact, have regarded its lack of a permanent bureaucracy as the key to its aggressiveness and independence.\n\nBut as the implications of the provision in the new bill have become clear, opposition has been building on both sides of the political aisle. One point of contention is exactly when the office would have naturally run its course without a hard end date.\n\nThe bipartisan opposition may not be unexpected given Mr. Bowen\u00d5s Republican credentials \u00d1 he served under George W. Bush both in Texas and in the White House \u00d1 and deep public skepticism on the Bush administration\u00d5s conduct of the war.\n\nSusan Collins, a Maine Republican who followed the bill closely as chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, says that she still does not know how the provision made its way into what is called the conference report, which reconciles differences between House and Senate versions of a bill.\n\nNeither the House nor the Senate version contained such a termination clause before the conference, all involved agree.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s truly a mystery to me,\u00d3 Ms. Collins said. \u00d2I looked at what I thought was the final version of the conference report and that provision was not in at that time.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2The one thing I can confirm is that this was a last-minute insertion,\u00d3 she said.\n\nA Republican spokesman for the committee, Josh Holly, said lawmakers should not have been surprised by the provision closing the inspector general\u00d5s office because it \u00d2was discussed very early in the conference process.\u00d3\n\nBut like several other members of the House and Senate who were contacted on the bill, Ms. Collins said that she feared the loss of oversight that could occur if the inspector general\u00d5s office went out of business, adding that she was already working on legislation with several Democratic and Republican senators to reverse the termination.\n\nOne of those, John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that Mr. Bowen was \u00d2making a valuable contribution to the Congressional and public understanding of this very complex and ever-changing situation in Iraq.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2Given that his office has performed important work and that much remains to be done,\u00d3 Mr. Warner added, \u00d2I intend to join Senator Collins in consulting with our colleagues to extend his charter.\u00d3\n\nWhile Senators Collins and Warner said they had nothing more than hunches on where the impetus for setting a termination date had originated, Congressional Democrats were less reserved.\n\n\u00d2It appears to me that the administration wants to silence the messenger that is giving us information about waste and fraud in Iraq,\u00d3 said Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who is the ranking minority member of the House Committee on Government Reform.\n\n\u00d2I just can\u00d5t see how one can look at this change without believing it\u00d5s political,\u00d3 he said.\n\nThe termination language was inserted into the bill by Congressional staff members working for Duncan Hunter, the California Republican who is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and who declared on Monday that he plans to run for president in 2008.\n\nMr. Holly, who is the House Armed Services spokesman as well as a member of Mr. Hunter\u00d5s staff, said that politics played no role and that there had been no direction from the administration or lobbying from the companies whose work in Iraq Mr. Bowen\u00d5s office has severely critiqued. Three of the companies that have been a particular focus of Mr. Bowen\u00d5s investigations, Halliburton, Parsons and Bechtel, said that they had made no effort to lobby against his office."}

{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "President Bush on Wednesday cited a teaching hospital in Najaf as perhaps the top example of a successful rebuilding project in Iraq. Since the American-led attack against local militias leveled large portions of Najaf in August 2004, however, the hospital has been most notable as a place where claims of success have fallen far short of reality.\n\nDuring two visits to the hospital by reporters for The New York Times over the past year, the most recent in late summer, work on refurbishing it had been limited to largely cosmetic work like new ceilings and lighting and fresh paint. Critical medical equipment was missing and the upper floors remained a chaotic mess.\n\nNumerous Iraqis at the site said the hospital had not been ruined by the militia that occupied it during the 2004 fighting, but instead by looters who entered after the American military left it unguarded after the battle.\n\nAmerican officials in charge of the project said $2 million had been spent on the first phase of a planned two-phase, $12 million renovation. So it is possible that work on the second phase has addressed some of the problems at the site.\n\nWhile Mr. Bush cited the modest security improvements in Najaf, 90 miles south of Baghdad, and in the northern city of Mosul, he did not point out the often highly sectarian nature of local security forces that now patrol the cities.\n\nOnly last Sunday, Ayad Allawi, the Iraqi prime minister who asked the American military to roust the militia from Najaf in 2003, was pelted with sticks and stones during his visit to the Imam Ali mosque in Najaf. Local security forces did nothing to stop the attack, almost certainly because they, like the mob outside the mosque, were loyal to the rebellious Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr. It was Mr. Sadr's militia that the Americans battled in Najaf in 2004.\n\nThe hospital, named after Mr. Sadr's father, is an example of the slow pace of rebuilding. Wayne White, a former State Department official whose responsibilities included Iraq from 2003 to 2005, and who is now at the Middle East Institute, a research organization, said the American mission in Iraq was often undermined by that slow pace.\n\n\"Not only does it run far behind Iraqi expectations, but in some areas we have not even recovered to what Iraq was before the invasion,\" Mr. White said.\n\nHe noted that some industries, including those involving metals and chemical production, still had not recovered from the invasion and the aftermath of looting, either.\n\nA major problem with assessing the progress in Iraq is that it is too dangerous to allow visitors to visit the projects freely, said Rick Barton of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n\"I bet if we could get around and see these places that they would not be the story that he's telling,\" he said. \"And I think he'd be shocked to see the story he's being fed.\"\n\nNot all the accounts that Mr. Bush offered of reconstruction were positive. He conceded problems with \"the infiltration of militia groups into some Iraqi security forces, especially the Iraqi police.\" And he did not assert that all had gone smoothly with the rebuilding effort.\n\n\"Like most of Iraq, the reconstruction in Najaf has proceeded with fits and starts since liberation - it's been uneven,\" Mr. Bush said.\n\nVisits to the cities Mr. Bush highlighted suggest that residents in Najaf feel safer and that Mosul's police force is more effective than when it collapsed in the face of the insurgency late in 2004. But the improvements have often produced little more than an assurance that the police, who still must be heavily backed by American firepower, will not flee in the face of an attack.\n\nIn Mosul, too, the starkly sectarian nature of the security forces is evident, as the largely Sunni police are sharply at odds with the Kurd-dominated Iraqi Army in the north.\n\nRebuilding in Mosul's extremely dangerous neighborhoods has been a difficult proposition, and killings of residents who cooperate with the government or with the Americans are still routine."}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "Looters stormed the weapons site at Al Qaqaa in the days after American troops swept through the area in early April 2003 on their way to Baghdad, gutting office buildings, carrying off munitions and even dismantling heavy machinery, three Iraqi witnesses and a regional security chief said Wednesday.\n\t\nThe Iraqis described an orgy of theft so extensive that enterprising residents rented their trucks to looters. But some looting was clearly indiscriminate, with people grabbing anything they could find and later heaving unwanted items off the trucks.\n\nTwo witnesses were employees of Al Qaqaa - one a chemical engineer and the other a mechanic - and the third was a former employee, a chemist, who had come back to retrieve his records, determined to keep them out of American hands. The mechanic, Ahmed Saleh Mezher, said employees asked the Americans to protect the site but were told this was not the soldiers' responsibility.\n\nThe accounts do not directly address the question of when 380 tons of powerful conventional explosives vanished from the site sometime after early March, the last time international inspectors checked the seals on the bunkers where the material was stored. It is possible that Iraqi forces removed some explosives before the invasion.\n\nBut the accounts make clear that what set off much if not all of the looting was the arrival and swift departure of American troops, who did not secure the site after inducing the Iraqi forces to abandon it.\n\n\"The looting started after the collapse of the regime,\" said Wathiq al-Dulaimi, a regional security chief, who was based nearby in Latifiya. But once it had begun, he said, the booty streamed toward Baghdad.\n\nEarlier this month, on Oct. 10, the directorate of national monitoring at the Ministry of Science and Technology notified the International Atomic Energy Agency that the explosives, which are used in demolition and missiles and are the raw material for plastic explosives, were missing. The agency has monitored the explosives because they can also be used as the initiator of an atomic bomb.\n\nAgency officials examined the explosives in January 2003 and noted in early March that their seals were still in place. On April 3, the Third Infantry Division arrived with the first American troops.\n\nChris Anderson, a photographer for U.S. News and World Report who was with the division's Second Brigade, recalled that the area was jammed with American armor on April 3 and 4, which he believed made the removal of the explosives unlikely. \"It would be quite improbable for this amount of weapons to be looted at that time because of the traffic jam of armor,\" he said.\n\nThe brigade blew up numerous caches of arms throughout the area, he said. Mr. Anderson said he did not enter the munitions compound.\n\nThe Second Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division arrived outside the site on April 10, under the command of Col. Joseph Anderson. The brigade had been ordered to move quickly to Baghdad because of civil disorder there after Mr. Hussein's government fell on April 9.\n\nThey gathered at Al Qaqaa, about 30 miles south, simply as a matter of convenience, Colonel Anderson said in an interview this week. He said that when he arrived at the site - unaware of its significance - he saw no signs of looting, but was not paying close attention.\n\nBecause he thought the brigade would be moving on to Baghdad within hours, Al Qaqaa was of no importance to his mission, he said, and he was unaware of the explosives that international inspectors said were hidden inside.\n\nPentagon officials said Wednesday that analysts were examining surveillance photographs of the munitions site. But they expressed doubts that the photographs, which showed vehicles at the location on several occasions early in the conflict, before American troops moved through the area, would be able to indicate conclusively when the explosives were removed.\n\nCol. David Perkins, who commanded the Second Brigade of the Third Infantry Division, called it \"very highly improbable\" that 380 tons of explosives could have been trucked out of Al Qaqaa in the weeks after American troops arrived.\n\nMoving that much material, said Colonel Perkins, who spoke Wednesday to news agencies and cable television, \"would have required dozens of heavy trucks and equipment moving along the same roadways as U.S. combat divisions occupied continually for weeks.\"\n\nHe conceded that some looting of the site had taken place. But a chemical engineer who worked at Al Qaqaa and identified himself only as Khalid said that once troops left the base itself, people streamed in to steal computers and anything else of value from the offices.

{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": " A $17 million energy project in California that was supposed to demonstrate the feasibility of extracting vast amounts of heat from the earth\u00d5s bedrock has been suspended indefinitely after the drilling essentially snagged on surface rock formations.\n\nThe project, run by AltaRock Energy, represents the Obama administration\u00d5s first major test of geothermal energy as a significant alternative to fossil fuels. But since drilling began in June, the project has encountered earthquake fears and scheduling delays.\n\nLast month, federal scientists said that the company had fallen far behind schedule because a huge rig hired to drill down about 12,000 feet, or more than two miles, on federal land had not been able to pierce surface formations called caprock. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Land Management approved a request by AltaRock to halt the drilling operation temporarily, said a bureau spokeswoman, Jan Bedrosian.\n\n\u00d2They need to come back to us with their future plans, and they have not done that,\u00d3 Ms. Bedrosian said.\n\nIn a statement, the company confirmed the suspension but gave few additional details. Several industry officials said it was virtually certain that AltaRock would dismantle and remove the enormously expensive rig from the site, which is known as the Geysers.\n\nThe federal scientists had said that after nearly two months of drilling, the project had reached depths of less than 4,000 feet. Technical problems are not uncommon in drilling operations, but some scientists said they were surprised at the severity of AltaRock\u00d5s difficulties given that the drilling essentially started at 3,200 feet, at the bottom of an older well, called E-7.\n\nAltaRock was awarded $6.25 million in financing by the Energy Department late last year to be on the vanguard of an effort to produce renewable energy by fracturing rock at the bottom of a deep hole and then circulating water through the cracks to generate steam \u00d1 a technique called an engineered or enhanced geothermal system. The company has also raised some $30 million in venture capital from firms including Google and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.\n\nBut after an article in The New York Times raised questions about whether AltaRock had been forthcoming about a similar project in Switzerland that produced earthquakes, the Energy Department and the land bureau said the company would not be allowed to fracture rock until a new review determined whether the project is safe. That review is still pending.\n\nIf the review allowed it to proceed, AltaRock had planned to drill a second well after the first was completed. Now it is unknown whether the company will try to restart drilling at the first well, move on to the second one or drop the project entirely.\n\nIn its statement on Wednesday, AltaRock said that the company \u00d2had encountered a number of physical difficulties in the drilling of well E-7,\u00d3 adding that the difficulties resulted from \u00d2geologic anomalies particular to the formation underlying this well location.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2As a result, we have suspended the drilling of this well as part of the Geysers demonstration project,\u00d3 the statement said.\n\nThe company said it was exploring alternate well locations at the Geysers and elsewhere.\n\nDuring a visit to the site in May, James T. Turner, the company\u00d5s senior vice president for operations, said that the project would cost $17 million to $18 million and that \u00d2the vast majority of that is on the two wells.\u00d3\n\nA spokeswoman for the Energy Department, Stephanie Mueller, said the department and the land bureau were working \u00d2to look into the problems that AltaRock has experienced to determine whether and how they can be remedied.\u00d3\n\nMs. Mueller added that \u00d2the department is taking these issues seriously as we weigh a final decision on the AltaRock project.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "A cholera epidemic in northern Iraq has infected approximately 7,000 people and could reach Baghdad within weeks as the disease spreads through the country\u00d5s decrepit and unsanitary water system, Iraqi health officials said Tuesday.\n\nThe World Health Organization reported that the epidemic is concentrated in the northern regions of Kirkuk and Sulaimaniya and that 10 people are known to have died. But Dr. Said Hakki, president of the Iraqi Red Crescent Society, a relief organization that has responded to the epidemic, said that new cases had turned up in the neighboring provinces, Erbil and Nineveh, indicating that the disease had spread.\n\nMost significant, Dr. Hakki said, were two cases in a village on the border between Kirkuk and Diyala Provinces, one involving a young girl. Baghdad is next to Diyala.\n\nBecause of that geographic spread, Dr. Hakki said, health officials at the Red Crescent estimate that cases will begin turning up in Baghdad in late September or early October, when temperatures are especially favorable for the growth of the bacteria Vibrio cholerae, which causes the disease by infecting the intestine.\n\nDr. Cerko Abdulla, chief of the Sulaimaniya health directorate, also said that the epidemic had begun spreading in adjacent provinces. \u00d2The water system represents the main problem,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2The disease can spread widely through water, and that\u00d5s a very serious matter.\u00d3\n\nIn Baghdad, Iraq\u00d5s deputy health minister, Dr. Adel Mohsin, said that he was not aware of any cases on the Diyala border. But he said that further spread of the epidemic was \u00d2very likely\u00d3 unless government agencies followed strict guidelines on water testing and maintaining sufficient levels of chlorination, which kills the bacteria.\n\nIn a chilling reminder of how difficult it may be to maintain those levels, Dr. Mohsin said that chlorine imports had been severely curtailed as a result of recent insurgent bombs that had been laced with chlorine, which in concentrated form can be deadly.\n\nDr. Hakki, of the Red Crescent, said that shallow wells contaminated by sewage around Sulaimaniya \u00d1 which had at least two cholera outbreaks in the decades before the American-led invasion in 2003 \u00d1 could have set off the epidemic. But problems that have developed since the invasion, like poor control of chlorination levels, have the potential to make this outbreak more dangerous, he said.\n\n\u00d2If the water has low chlorination, Vibrio cholerae will go through the central supply,\u00d3 Dr. Hakki said, and the disease will spread \u00d2like a fire in a haystack.\u00d3\n\nDr. Burhan Omar, deputy director of Kirkuk General Hospital, said that because of such problems, water purification plants themselves could be contaminated with the bacteria. Those plants, in turn, can \u00d2bring the disease from the northern parts to the middle and southern parts of Iraq.\u00d3\n\nIn fact, if those plants are contaminated, the epidemic could hopscotch all the way to Basra, in the south, Dr. Omar said.\n\nCholera is caused by infection of the intestine with the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. The infection can be mild or even have no symptoms, but about one in 20 infected people become extremely ill, with profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting and leg cramps. Without treatment, rapid loss of body fluids causes dehydration and shock, and a person can die within hours.\n\nCholera does not usually spread directly from person to person, so casual contact with infected people is not risky, and quarantine is not necessary. But household members, who have closer contact, may contract it, and can sometimes avoid getting sick by taking the antibiotic tetracycline.\n\nPeople contract cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the bacteria, which comes from the feces of an infected person. Exposure to raw sewage and contaminated, untreated drinking water can cause epidemics. If treated water is not available, boiling will kill the bacteria. During epidemics, people need to avoid raw vegetables.\n\nThe major human displacement caused by the Iraq conflict \u00d1 people being driven from their homes or simply choosing to leave \u00d1 is likely to be driving the epidemic, officials say.\n\nFadela Chaib, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization, said: \u00d2Frankly speaking, it\u00d5s possible that cholera will spread to neighboring provinces and even to Baghdad, because there is a lot of people movement. People can be carrying the bacteria in their bodies and show no symptoms, and the bacteria can stay in the body for 7 to 14 days and be shed, potentially contaminating other individuals.\u00d3\n\nShe said the health organization had sent two truckloads of medical supplies to Erbil, in the north, including oral rehydration salts and intravenous fluids. The group is also testing water samples for contamination and helping the local government to distribute pamphlets and posters urging people to wash their hands and purify their water by boiling it or adding chlorine tablets to kill the bacteria.\n\nAlthough there are vaccines to prevent cholera, Ms. Chaib said they were \u00d2not efficient,\u00d3 and the health organization did not provide them or recommend them, preferring to emphasize hygiene, clean drinking water, sanitation and education.\n\nMs. Chaib said that health organization personnel were working in the north and that \u00d2it may be more easy for them to be in the north than in Baghdad, for example, because the situation in the north is more manageable than in the rest of the country.\u00d3\n\nShould cholera break out in Baghdad, it would be far more difficult to send in health workers and protect them."}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "The heavy clay-laced mud behind the cattle pen on Antoine Renault\u00d5s farm looks as treacherous as it must have been nearly 600 years ago, when King Henry V rode from a spot near here to lead a sodden and exhausted English Army against a French force that was said to outnumber his by as much as five to one.\n\nPatrick Fenet, a medieval enthusiast dressed as an English longbowman, aiming across the the field where the Battle of Agincourt took place in northern France.\n\nNo one can ever take away the shocking victory by Henry and his \u00d2band of brothers,\u00d3 as Shakespeare would famously call them, on St. Crispin\u00d5s Day, Oct. 25, 1415. They devastated a force of heavily armored French nobles who had gotten bogged down in the region\u00d5s sucking mud, riddled by thousands of arrows from English longbowmen and outmaneuvered by common soldiers with much lighter gear. It would become known as the Battle of Agincourt.\n\nBut Agincourt\u00d5s status as perhaps the greatest victory against overwhelming odds in military history \u00d1 and a keystone of the English self-image \u00d1 has been called into doubt by a group of historians in Britain and France who have painstakingly combed an array of military and tax records from that time and now take a skeptical view of the figures handed down by medieval chroniclers.\n\nThe historians have concluded that the English could not have been outnumbered by more than about two to one. And depending on how the math is carried out, Henry may well have faced something closer to an even fight, said Anne Curry, a professor at the University of Southampton who is leading the study.\n\nThose cold figures threaten an image of the battle that even professional researchers and academics have been reluctant to challenge in the face of Shakespearean verse and centuries of English pride, Ms. Curry said.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s just a myth, but it\u00d5s a myth that\u00d5s part of the British psyche,\u00d3 Ms. Curry said.\n\nThe work, which has received both glowing praise and sharp criticism from other historians in the United States and Europe, is the most striking of the revisionist accounts to emerge from a new science of military history. The new accounts tend to be not only more quantitative but also more attuned to political, cultural and technological factors, and focus more on the experience of the common soldier than on grand strategies and heroic deeds.\n\nThe approach has drastically changed views on everything from Roman battles with Germanic tribes, to Napoleon\u00d5s disastrous occupation of Spain, to the Tet offensive in the Vietnam War. But the most telling gauge of the respect being given to the new historians and their penchant for tearing down established wisdom is that it has now become almost routine for American commanders to call on them for advice on strategy and tactics in Afghanistan, Iraq and other present-day conflicts.\n\nThe most influential example is the \u00d2Counterinsurgency Field Manual\u00d3 adopted in 2006 by the United States Army and Marines and smack in the middle of the debate over whether to increase troop levels in Afghanistan.\n\nGen. David H. Petraeus, who oversees the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as the head of the United States Central Command, drew on dozens of academic historians and other experts to create the manual. And he named Conrad Crane, director of the United States Army Military History Institute at the Army War College, as the lead writer.\n\nDrawing on dozens of historical conflicts, the manual\u00d5s prime conclusion is the assertion that insurgencies cannot be defeated without protecting and winning over the general population, regardless of how effective direct strikes on enemy fighters may be.\n\nMr. Crane said that some of his own early historical research involved a comparison of strategic bombing campaigns with attacks on civilians by rampaging armies during the Hundred Years\u00d5 War, when England tried and ultimately failed to assert control over continental France. Agincourt was perhaps the most stirring victory the English would ever achieve on French soil during the conflict.\n\nThe Hundred Years\u00d5 War never made it into the field manual \u00d1 the name itself may have served as a deterrent \u00d1 but after sounding numerous cautions on the vast differences in time, technology and political aims, historians working in the area say that there are some uncanny parallels with contemporary foreign conflicts.\n\nFor one thing, by the time Henry landed near the mouth of the Seine on Aug. 14, 1415, and began a rather uninspiring siege of a town called Harfleur, France was on the verge of a civil war, with factions called the Burgundians and the Armagnacs at loggerheads. Henry would eventually forge an alliance with the Burgundians, who in today\u00d5s terms would become his \u00d2local security forces\u00d3 in Normandy, and he cultivated the support of local merchants and clerics, all practices that would have been heartily endorsed by the counterinsurgency manual.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5m not one who sees history repeating itself, but I think a lot of attitudes do,\u00d3 said Kelly DeVries, a professor of history at Loyola University Maryland who has written extensively on medieval warfare. Mr. DeVries said that fighters from across the region began filtering toward the Armagnac camp as soon as Henry became allied with their enemies. \u00d2Very much like Al Qaeda in Iraq, there were very diverse forces coming from very, very different places to fight,\u00d3 Mr. DeVries said.\n\nBut first Henry would have his chance at Agincourt. After taking Harfleur, he marched rapidly north and crossed the Somme River, his army depleted by dysentery and battle losses and growing hungry and fatigued.\n\nAt the same time, the fractious French forces hastily gathered to meet him.\n\nIt is here that historians themselves begin fighting, and several take exception to the new scholarship by Ms. Curry\u00d5s team"}
{"klass": "james_glanz", "text": "Highly promising figures that the administration cited to demonstrate economic progress in Iraq last fall, when Congress was considering whether to continue financing the war, cannot be substantiated by official Iraqi budget records, the Government Accountability Office reported Tuesday.\n\nThe Iraqi government had been severely criticized for failing to spend billions of dollars of its oil revenues in 2006 to finance its own reconstruction, but last September the administration said Iraq had greatly accelerated such spending. By July 2007, the administration said, Iraq had spent some 24 percent of $10 billion set aside for reconstruction that year.\n\nAs Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, and Ryan C. Crocker, the American ambassador to Iraq, prepared in September to report to Congress on the state of the war, the economic figures were a rare sign of progress within Iraq\u00d5s often dysfunctional government.\n\nBut in its report on Tuesday, the accountability office said official Iraqi Finance Ministry records showed that Iraq had spent only 4.4 percent of the reconstruction budget by August 2007. It also said that the rate of spending had substantially slowed from the previous year.\n\nThe reason for the difference, said Joseph A. Christoff, the G.A.O.\u00d5s director of international affairs and trade, was that few official Iraqi figures for 2007 were available when General Petraeus and Mr. Crocker went to Congress.\n\nSo the administration, with the help of the Finance Ministry in Baghdad, appears to have relied on a combination of indicators, including real expenditures, ministries\u00d5 suggestions of projects they intended to carry out, and contracts that were still under negotiation, Mr. Christoff said. But actual spending does not seem to have lived up to those estimates for spending on reconstruction, a budget item sometimes called capital or investment expenditures, he added.\n\n\u00d2So it looked like an improvement, but it wasn\u00d5t an improvement,\u00d3 he said.\n\nThe United States Treasury Department and State Department criticized the conclusions in comments included in the report, saying that the G.A.O. had not accounted for all places in the Iraqi budget where investment or capital expenditures had been made. But the report said those departments had not been able to identify specific places where those other expenditures had taken place.\n\nA spokeswoman for the United States Embassy in Baghdad said Tuesday that she could not comment. The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter the United States spent more than $40 billion to rebuild Iraq\u00d5s faltering electricity, water, sewage, transportation and petroleum sectors, with mixed results at best, Iraq\u00d5s failure to devote its own resources to continue the task brought severe criticism from Western government and technical organizations.\n\nThe reasons for that failure, Iraqi and American officials said, included the challenges of carrying out construction projects in a dangerous countryside, a lack of expertise in a nation drained of technical talent, and a fear that new anticorruption measures would be widely used to prosecute Iraqi officials accustomed to operating in a culture of bribes and financial back-scratching.\n\nStill, after Iraq\u00d5s failure to spend its own money on reconstruction was first disclosed in late 2006, Iraqi and American officials repeatedly asserted that the problems would be much less severe the next year, as the new government led by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki found its way.\n\nIn addition, the officials said, with the American troop increase and security improvements, security problems would lessen. And American training programs were producing more skilled Iraqi contracting and finance officials. The figures put forth in September appeared to endorse those claims.\n\nBut the accountability office figures, which Mr. Christoff said were taken directly from Finance Ministry records, show that through August 2007 the Iraqi government had spent less than half the percentage of its investment budget that it had spent in the same period in 2006.\n\nRick Barton, co-director of the postconflict reconstruction project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said all measures of economic progress in Iraq were difficult to pin down precisely. But he said the United States, taking those difficulties into account, should have been wary of touting progress before the facts were clear.\n\n\u00d2The data in these places is hugely unreliable to begin with, primarily because nobody gets out in the field to see what\u00d5s going on,\u00d3 Mr. Barton said. \u00d2But what is probably troubling is that when you know this, you shouldn\u00d5t be using this to create wrong impressions or false impressions and pretending that you know what\u00d5s going on.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "Just a year ago, working as a product presenter at an auto show was a pretty straightforward job. You stood next to a vehicle, you called it a marvel of engineering, style and comfort and then you fielded softball questions like, \u00d2What does this baby cost?\u00d3\n\nAt the Pontiac exhibit of the New York auto show at the Javits Center, Christine Alt Parry is wearing the same outfit as last year.\n\nBut that was before the bailout. Now that the government has helped General Motors and Chrysler stave off bankruptcy with billions of dollars in loans, these companies are finding somewhat hostile crowds at their exhibits. Which leads to scenes like the one on Friday at the New York auto show, where a blond woman in a tight black dress stood on a rotating platform and pitched the sporty Dodge Circuit, one of five electric cars that Chrysler is developing.\n\nDonald Han, an accountant from Queens, sounded unmoved. \u00d2Why now?\u00d3 he asked the woman, rather curtly, once she had finished her patter. \u00d2How come you\u00d5ve got to nearly go bankrupt before you come out with a car like this?\u00d3\n\nLong a glamorous showcase for carmakers, auto shows have lately become a place for buyers and gawkers to vent. Few of the attendees at the Javits Center, where the New York show runs until Sunday, will ever encounter a top executive from G.M. or Chrysler. But all of them get within heckling range of the presenters and for some, that is good enough.\n\nIt does not seem to matter that these women \u00d1 they are nearly all women, most of them young and attractive \u00d1 work part time for marketing firms and talent agencies that have contracts to run the exhibits. Many know little about the car companies they are working for beyond the scripts they have memorized.\n\n\u00d2I try to explain that we\u00d5re not involved in corporate decisions, so complaining to us doesn\u00d5t really make a lot of sense,\u00d3 said Kerri Moss, standing on a large turntable next to a Jeep 4X4 Laredo, a Chrysler product. Recently laid off from her job as a teacher, she is trying to earn some money on the car show circuit, which runs from September to May. \u00d2And if that doesn\u00d5t work, I tell them we\u00d5re doing the best we can.\u00d3\n\nOften, that does not work either. One G.M. presenter said a woman told her the company was responsible for the death of American soldiers in Iraq. The logic went like this: if G.M. made more fuel-efficient cars, the country would not need so much oil, and if the country did not need oil, United States troops would never have invaded.\n\n\u00d2I didn\u00d5t say anything,\u00d3 recalled the presenter, who like many others here declined to give her name because she is not supposed to speak to the news media. \u00d2What can you possibly say? \u00d4Thanks?\u00d5 \u00d3\n\nEven if they ignore the snide comments and occasional jeers, presenting for an ailing car company just is not as fun as working for one that is thriving. The G.M. and Chrysler spaces are smaller and less flashy than they were a year ago.\n\nThe Jeep exhibit used to have a 54-foot-wide waterfall that continuously dropped 1,000 gallons of water and was programmed, like an ink jet printer, to spell out brand names and logos in the falling streams. Not any more.\n\nAnd for the first time, some G.M. presenters are wearing the same outfits they wore last year.\n\n\u00d2We used to get a new one every season,\u00d3 said Christine Alt Parry, during a break from her duties beside a black 2010 GMC Terrain, wearing the flower-pattern dark blazer and black slacks she wore a year ago. \u00d2I think they\u00d5re trying to save some money.\u00d3\n\nDownstairs at the Kia exhibit, meanwhile, it is party time. A D.J. is mixing oom-chick-oom-chick club tracks on an Apple laptop, beside huge LED screens that spell out phrases like \u00d2Schwing!\u00d3 and \u00d2Kia Sips Gas.\u00d3 The men are wearing new Hugo Boss suits, with dark-purple hankies, and the women are wearing designer dresses bought recently at the Beverly Center in Los Angeles.\n\nOn Friday, Subaru handed out flutes of Brut Cuvee Champagne to visiting Finnish car dealers. And they are preening over at the Hyundai space, where the staff is decked out in new Armani jackets, Cole Haan sweaters and a few other items picked up at Nordstrom.\n\n\u00d2I haven\u00d5t seen anyone who looks as sharp as we do,\u00d3 said Mark Laffrey, the wardrobe consultant.\n\nThe exhibit for Ford, a company in better financial shape than its crosstown rivals in Detroit, is huge and dominated by an atmosphere that could be described as we-didn\u00d5t-take-your-money festive. There are slot car races, a magician doing card tricks, and the crew of MTV\u00d5s \u00d2Pimp My Ride\u00d3 upgrading a car in a cordoned-off section called Mustang Alley, which has a spring-break vibe.\n\n\u00d2We\u00d5re the bad boys of the auto show!\u00d3 yells a man who calls himself Flames, one of the ride-pimpers, as he gets to work.\n\nNot that any of these companies are making huge sums of money. But unlike G.M. and Chrysler, they do not need to project an air of austerity and seriousness.\n\nSo is this new image winning over potential buyers? Well, there are people who say they would indeed buy from either company. But many attendees echoed the sentiments of Mark Lee, who was photographing his daughter next to the gleaming rims of a 6,000-pound Hummer. \u00d2Absolutely not,\u00d3 he said when asked if he was tempted.\n\nOn the other side of the hall, an electrician, Kurt Moore of Pleasant Valley, N.Y., sat in a Toyota Highlander and explained why he was not going to buy American anytime soon.\n\n\u00d2You know how they say, \u00d4Never buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday?\u00d5 \u00d3 he said, getting comfortable in the passenger seat. \u00d2It\u00d5s because the people building the cars aren\u00d5t focused on the job. Well, how well do you think they\u00d5re focused today, with all this talk about how they\u00d5re going to lose their jobs?\u00d3\n\nThe G.M. and Chrysler presenters have heard questions like that, and dozens of variations of it, in the last couple months.\n\n\u00d2We get a lot of, \u00d4You\u00d5re going out of business,\u00d5 \u00d4You guys are going bankrupt,\u00d5 \u00d3 said Shannon Melahn, part of the Chrysler presenting team. She shrugged and added, \u00d2We just smile.\u00d3"}

But he hasn\u00d5t ordered this orgy of meat, seafood and sesame peanut glaze because he\u00d5s feeling peckish. He has summoned this spread because he\u00d5s feeling proud.\n\nFor the last two years, Mr. Beall has spent upward of $100 million of his company\u00d5s money in a grand, all-consuming campaign to upgrade the brand \u00d1 its food, its service and, most recently, its d\u008ecor, which for a long time was dominated by faux Tiffany lamps and rummage-sale bric-a-brac. Now Ruby Tuesday features leather banquettes and dark varnished wood, and the wait staff is clad in hipster black shirts and black pants. The new menu includes upmarket fare, like lobster tails, and offers suggestions about which wine will work with your dish.\n\n\u00d2Pairs well with Penfolds Koonunga Hill Shiraz,\u00d3 it says under a picture of the surf and turf.\n\nThe menu is a long way from the burger-and-beer joint that Mr. Beall, then 21, created in 1972 on the campus of the University of Tennessee, where he was a student.\n\nIf he\u00d5d picked any other moment during his years atop this international empire of 896 restaurants, the makeover might have merely been very hard. But the recession started right about the time that those faux Tiffany lamps were yanked from the ceilings. The chain has been trying to transform itself into the fancier, pricier alternative to much larger rivals like Applebee\u00d5s just as consumers have been hoarding their dimes.\n\nAmericans eat 20 million meals a week at casual-dining chains, according to Technomic, a restaurant consulting firm \u00d1 a number second only to fast food.\n\nThe companies that gave the world such singular creations as riblet platters, Southwestern egg rolls and dessert shooters stay so keenly attuned to our appetites and urges that you could tell the story of our country\u00d5s ever-evolving, slightly twisted love affair with food and commerce with a collection of menus from Chili\u00d5s, T.G.I. Friday\u00d5s and their ilk.\n\nWhen Ruby Tuesday began its self-enhancement drive, it hoped merely to join a slightly posher neighborhood, the place where Olive Garden and Outback Steakhouse live. But by commencing just before the bust and sticking to its strategy, the company has become an object lesson in recession-era economics, demonstrating both the perils and possible upsides of pushing lobster in an age of chicken pot pie.\n\nTHE company is haunted by the stark metrics of its trade: Ruby Tuesday\u00d5s same-store sales are down about 8 percent from last year, when it closed 54 restaurants. With traffic flagging, a war of discounts and specials broke out in the middle of last year, and the chain started offering buy-one-get-one-free deals \u00d1 a k a \u00d2Bogos\u00d3 \u00d1 to get customers in the door.\n\nWall Street began to worry that the company would break its debt covenants, and Ruby Tuesday shares, which traded as high as $33 a few years back, fell to 85 cents in March. A side of the creamy mashed cauliflower cost about three times as much.\n\nGoodbye, Ruby Tuesday?\n\nNot quite.\n\nThe stock has rebounded to $6.54, and the company has raised money to pay down debt. Even if a sense of imminent doom has passed, however, nobody is yet calling Mr. Beall\u00d5s makeover a success.\n\nThe company says that traffic is up in the most recent quarter, but according to Technomic, same-store sales at Chili\u00d5s, Applebee\u00d5s and Ruby Tuesday have fallen at roughly the same rate, suggesting that diners either haven\u00d5t heard about the changes or can\u00d5t taste the difference.\n\n\u00d2You ask people in surveys why they chose one casual dining chain over the other and they\u00d5ll say, \u00d4because the line was shorter,\u00d5 \u00d3 says Ron Paul, the president of Technomic. \u00d2Ruby\u00d5s is trying to break out of that, and Sandy\u00d5s point is correct \u00d1 if and when people decide to go back to casual dining, you need to give them a reason to do it.

{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "Already facing a spate of private lawsuits, the legal troubles of the country\u00d5s largest credit rating agencies deepened on Friday when the attorney general of Ohio sued Moody\u00d5s Investors Service, Standard & Poor\u00d5s and Fitch, claiming that they had cost state retirement and pension funds some $457 million by approving high-risk Wall Street securities that went bust in the financial collapse.\n\nRichard Cordray, Ohio\u00d5s attorney general, sued the nation\u00d5s largest credit rating agencies, alleging that they cost the state\u00d5s pension funds $457 million by approving securities that went bust.\n\nThe case could test whether the agencies\u00d5 ratings are constitutionally protected as a form of free speech.\n\nThe lawsuit asserts that Moody\u00d5s, Standard & Poor\u00d5s and Fitch were in league with the banks and other issuers, helping to create an assortment of exotic financial instruments that led to a disastrous bubble in the housing market.\n\n\u00d2We believe that the credit rating agencies, in exchange for fees, departed from their objective, neutral role as arbiters,\u00d3 the attorney general, Richard Cordray, said at a news conference. \u00d2At minimum, they were aiding and abetting misconduct by issuers.\u00d3\n\nHe accused the companies of selling their integrity to the highest bidder.\n\nSteven Weiss, a spokesman for McGraw-Hill, which owns S.& P., said that the lawsuit had no merit and that the company would vigorously defend itself.\n\n\u00d2A recent Securities and Exchange Commission examination of our business practices found no evidence that decisions about rating methodologies or models were based on attracting market share,\u00d3 he said.\n\nMichael Adler, a spokesman for Moody\u00d5s, also disputed the claims. \u00d2It is unfortunate that the state attorney general, rather than engaging in an objective review and constructive dialogue regarding credit ratings, instead appears to be seeking new scapegoats for investment losses incurred during an unprecedented global market disruption,\u00d3 he said.\n\nA spokesman for Fitch said the company would not comment because it had not seen the lawsuit.\n\nThe litigation adds to a growing stack of lawsuits against the three largest credit rating agencies, which together command an 85 percent share of the market. Since the credit crisis began last year, dozens of investors have sought to recover billions of dollars from worthless or nearly worthless bonds on which the rating agencies had conferred their highest grades.\n\nOne of those groups is largest pension fund in the country, the California Public Employees Retirement System, which filed a lawsuit in state court in California in July, claiming that \u00d2wildly inaccurate ratings\u00d3 had led to roughly $1 billion in losses.\n\nAnd more litigation is likely. As part of a broader financial reform, Congress is considering provisions that make it easier for plaintiffs to sue rating agencies. And the Ohio attorney general\u00d5s action raises the possibility of similar filings from other states. California\u00d5s attorney general, Jerry Brown, said in September that his office was investigating the rating agencies, with an eye toward determining \u00d2how these agencies could get it so wrong and whether they violated California law in the process.\u00d3\n\nAs a group, the attorneys general have proved formidable opponents, most notably in the landmark litigation and multibillion-dollar settlement against tobacco makers in 1998.\n\nTo date, however, the rating agencies are undefeated in court, and aside from one modest settlement in a case 10 years ago, no one has forced them to hand over any money. Moody\u00d5s, S.& P. and Fitch have successfully argued that their ratings are essentially opinions about the future, and therefore subject to First Amendment protections identical to those of journalists.\n\nBut that was before billions of dollars in triple-A rated bonds went bad in the financial crisis that started last year, and before Congress extracted a number of internal e-mail messages from the companies, suggesting that employees were aware they were giving their blessing to bonds that were all but doomed. In one of those messages, an S.& P. analyst said that a deal \u00d2could be structured by cows and we\u00d5d rate it.\u00d3\n\nRecent cases, like the suit filed Friday, are founded on the premise that the companies were aware that investments they said were sturdy were dangerously unsafe. And if analysts knew that they were overstating the quality of the products they rated, and did so because it was a path to profits, the ratings could forfeit First Amendment protections, legal experts say.\n\n\u00d2If they hold themselves out to the marketplace as objective when in fact they are influenced by the fees they are receiving, then they are perpetrating a falsehood on the marketplace,\u00d3 said Rodney A. Smolla, dean of the Washington and Lee University School of Law. \u00d2The First Amendment doesn\u00d5t extend to the deliberate manipulation of financial markets.\u00d3\n\nThe 73-page complaint, filed on behalf of Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund, the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System and other groups, claims that in recent years the rating agencies abandoned their role as impartial referees as they began binging on fees from deals involving mortgage-backed securities.\n\nAt the root of the problem, according to the complaint, is the business model of rating agencies, which are paid by the issuers of the securities they are paid to appraise. The lawsuit, and many critics of the companies, have described that arrangement as a glaring conflict of interest.\n\n\u00d2Given that the rating agencies did not receive their full fees for a deal unless the deal was completed and the requested rating was provided,\u00d3 the attorney general\u00d5s suit maintains, \u00d2they had an acute financial incentive to relax their stated standards of \u00d4integrity\u00d5 and \u00d4objectivity\u00d5 to placate their clients.\u00d3\n\nTo complicate problems in the system of incentives, the lawsuit states, the methodologies used by the rating agencies were outdated and flawed. By the time those flaws were obvious, nearly half a billion dollars in pension and retirement funds had evaporated in Ohio, revealing the bonds to be \u00d2high-risk securities that both issuers and rating agencies knew to be little more than a house of cards,\u00d3 the complaint states."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "Wade F. B. Thompson, who revived the beloved Airstream brand of travel trailers and led a campaign to renovate the historic Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan, died on Nov. 12 at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 69.\n\nThe cause was complications of colon cancer, said his wife, Angela Thompson.\n\nA native of New Zealand, Mr. Thompson earned a bachelor of commerce degree in 1962 and won a scholarship to attend New York University, where he earned an M.B.A, in 1964. He started his career in the mergers and acquisitions department at Sperry & Hutchinson, the company that distributed S&H Green Stamps.\n\nBut he wanted to run a company of his own and he found an eager partner in Peter Orthwein, whom he had met in 1976 at an Association for Corporate Growth lunch. The two soon bought the Hi-Lo Trailer Company, an Ohio maker of travel trailers. The price for the company was less than $1 million, Mr. Orthwein recalled, because the trailer industry had fallen out of favor in the years after the gasoline lines of the 1970s.\n\n\u00d2Neither of us knew anything about recreational vehicles,\u00d3 Mr. Orthwein said. \u00d2But the company had a bunch of cash on its balance sheet and assets we could borrow against.\u00d3\n\nIn 1980, the two formed Thor Industries \u00d1 named using the first two letters of their last names \u00d1 and bought Airstream, then a money-losing subsidiary of Beatrice Foods. The brand had a long history and a revered line of products: ovoid-shaped, aluminum-side trailers that were originally based on the design of the Pan Am Clipper, one of the early trans-Atlantic passenger planes.\n\nThe company survived the Depression and prospered for decades. But the oil supply crisis of the \u00d570s had hurt Airstream, which lost $12 million the year before Thor Industries bought it.\n\nA detail-oriented man with an aversion to debt, Mr. Thompson showed up at Airstream\u00d5s headquarters, in Jackson Center, Ohio, and handed out black pens, telling employees, \u00d2There isn\u00d5t going to be any more red ink at this company.\u00d3\n\nWith Mr. Thompson in charge of day-to-day operations \u00d1 he flew to Ohio during the work week, and returned to his home in Scarsdale, N.Y., on the weekend \u00d1 Thor laid off a number of managers, eliminated fictitious warranty claims by dealers and reconfigured the product line to make it more profitable.\n\nThe company went public in 1984 and eventually branched out into making motor homes and transit buses. At the company\u00d5s peak, in 2006, it sold more than 100,000 trailers, buses and motor homes.\n\nBesides Angela, his wife of 42 years, his survivors include two children, Charles A. Y. Thompson and Amanda Jane Thompson Riegel, and six grandchildren.\n\nAfter they became empty-nesters, Mr. Thompson and his wife moved to Manhattan from Scarsdale. They lived for a time across the street from the Park Avenue Armory, once known as the Seventh Regiment Armory, which for many years served as both a military installation and a social gathering site for some of the most famous of New York\u00d5s Gilded Age families.\n\nBut the building had been neglected, and its condition appalled him. He spent more than a decade and $35 million of his own money to help restore it. After starting a conservancy for the Armory, modeled on the one that cares for Central Park, Mr. Thompson and a group of allies persuaded the state to give the conservancy a 99-year lease to update, repair and care for the building. The lease began in 2006.\n\n\u00d2We\u00d5re still in the cleanup stage,\u00d3 said Rebecca Robertson, the chief executive of the conservancy. \u00d2There used to be vermin, lead paint and leaky roofs in here.\u00d3 Now, she said, there are concerts and art exhibits."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "A BUNCH of the guys drove straight to a bar. You get laid off from a job that pays $15 an hour, plus health care and other benefits \u00d1 it\u00d5s Miller time. Time for a convoy to one of the watering holes in this town, 80 miles west of Omaha, where you can buy a beer at 10 in the morning.\n\nFew of the employees of Katana Summit, a wind-tower manufacturer, saw it coming. On that day in early August, and in another round of cuts a few weeks later, about half of the plant\u00d5s 195-person payroll was eliminated, a shock that came with one notable consolation: the executives said they hoped to hire everyone back soon.\n\nThey seemed to mean it, too. As Kevin Strudthoff, the chief executive, explained that day, this was a \u00d2temporary layoff,\u00d3 but there was a limit to what Katana could promise. The company, privately held, said it landed a multimillion-dollar deal last year to provide 225 wind towers to a turbine maker that it declined to identify. But when the credit crisis hit, wind-farm developers found it all but impossible to raise money, killing demand for wind towers.\n\nIn June, the turbine maker called Katana and said it was temporarily suspending its order. Layoffs were then inevitable.\n\nCharles Salak, a burly, 39-year-old welder with an unruly goatee, was among the newly jobless that morning. But instead of commiserating with friends at the Sahara Lounge, he drove directly to the unemployment office, or Workforce Development, as it is called here. He was thinking about his wife and three children and how nuts he would go without a paycheck and something to do. Why not start looking right away?\n\n\u00d2I was getting these text messages from my friends saying: \u00d4Where are you?\u00d5 We got a cold one for you,\u00d5 \u00d3 he recalled over lunch at a local fast-food chain called Runza. \u00d2I just wrote them back and said, \u00d4Nah, you guys drink it.\u00d5 \u00d3\n\nThe question now is whether that order for 225 towers will be scaled back or canceled. If it\u00d5s canceled, Katana Summit won\u00d5t operate at even a fraction of full capacity anytime soon and won\u00d5t need Charles Salak and his co-workers for the foreseeable future \u00d1 if, indeed, it ever needs them again.\n\nIt is early September, and Mr. Salak and Mr. Strudthoff \u00d1 the semiterminated and the semiterminator \u00d1 are living parallel lives. Neither of these men is idle, but each is living in that awkward, immiserating limbo where it\u00d5s clear, or maybe just clearer than usual, that your future and financial well-being are determined by forces beyond your control.\n\nThat limbo is arguably the quintessential American experience of the moment. When the Great Recession is dissected into its component parts, this might be remembered as the Waiting Phase. It\u00d5s not as scary as the Plummeting Phase of last year, or as event-filled as the To-the-Ramparts Phase of several months ago, but that doesn\u00d5t make it any easier.\n\nA real recovery, we have heard time and again, won\u00d5t begin in earnest until the jobless rate, now at a 26-year high of 9.7 percent, starts to fall. But what will it take for the rehiring to start? What do companies like Katana need to see before they call back people like Charles Salak?\n\nWhat, in other words, are we waiting for?\n\nEvery company has a different answer, because every company is linked to a different piece of the Rube Goldberg contraption that is our economy. In the case of Mr. Salak and Katana, the wait is connected to a broad array of factors: the flow of credit, green power initiatives, dozens of small and large choices in the hands of people who live far from here.\n\nUltimately, though, the wait at Katana boils down to a phone call. Under terms of the deal, the turbine maker had until the close of business on Sept. 25 \u00d1 last Friday \u00d1 to decide whether to scale back its order or walk away from it altogether.\n\nStop or go. Wait or get back to work. At the time of this visit to Columbus, nobody knew what would happen.\n\n\u00d2I hope they call us early in the day,\u00d3 said Mr. Strudthoff a couple of weeks back. \u00d2That would be courteous.\u00d3\n\nCOLUMBUS, a city of 21,000, has the highest per-capita rate of manufacturing employment of any place in Nebraska. It produces car seats, burger patties, ethanol, bug traps, dog kennels, grain tubs \u00d1 the list goes on. A handful of Fortune 500 companies have a presence here."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "IN the middle of the kitchen at Daniel, a four-star restaurant on the Upper East Side, a set of steep stairs leads to a cozy little nook known as the skybox. It has one lacquered-wood table, room for four diners, a television and two large windows overlooking the action below. The space feels like the eating quarters of a yacht set in a tree house.\n\nMr. Boulud, second from left in foreground, is trying to balance thrift and quality for this site, his 10th restaurant.\n\nThe skybox is available to customers by special request, but on a recent afternoon, the chef and co-owner Daniel Boulud is sitting here in a white, double-breasted chef\u00d5s coat, ready for the latest round of taste tests for a restaurant called DBGB. His first foray into casual fare and his 10th restaurant, it is slated to open on the Lower East Side in about two weeks.\n\nFirst up is a small dish of escargot and tomatoes topped with a puff pastry, which is set before him by Jim Leiken, 34, who will be in charge of DBGB\u00d5s kitchen.\n\n\u00d2Did you hear the music?\u00d3 Mr. Boulud asks as he studies the plate and grabs some silverware.\n\n\u00d2Yeah, it sizzled,\u00d3 Mr. Leiken replies.\n\nMr. Boulud chews for a moment, and then there is silence.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5m still not convinced,\u00d3 he finally says, speaking with the sort of French accent that sounds authoritative in any discussion of flavor. \u00d2I mean, I love escargot and garlic, and all that. But I\u00d5m still thinking of doing a custard on the bottom and then a pur\u008ee of escargot and then the puff pastry so you have almost a reverse tart.\u00d3\n\nKnown for his sumptuous menus and seamless service, Mr. Boulud \u00d1 the name, brain and palate behind one of the country\u00d5s gold-plated dining empires \u00d1 has already taken a bow for just about every round of applause that the industry has to offer. With the Dinex Group, a management company he co-founded, he and a team of managers and accountants oversee an operation with more than 900 employees in markets as far-flung as Beijing and Vancouver.\n\nThey have not misfired yet, but Mr. Boulud and his cadre might be trying their trickiest maneuver to date, creating DBGB at a moment that is smiling on fast food and little else. In this environment, you could forgive the man for cutting a few corners, or scaling back his ambitions.\n\nBut during Round 8 of recipe tests, on Tuesday, he refuses to grade on the curve. He stoically appraises entrees and appetizers in what feels like a marathon episode of \u00d2Top Chef\u00d3 \u00d1 except that this judge has helped conceive the dishes and never seems very pleased by the results.\n\nThe lamb ribs confit with roasted lamb leg and spring beans? \u00d2Maybe a little more herbs in it,\u00d3 he suggests. The Maryland lump crab cake with a curry sauce and pickled radish? \u00d2More crab, less garnish.\u00d3 The passion fruit crepe with mango slices? \u00d2We\u00d5re still not there.\u00d3\n\nWe sit across from Mr. Boulud, shamelessly pillaging the leftovers and thinking: huh? Each dish seems head-spinningly yummy, but Mr. Boulud summons enthusiasm only when he tries a sausage called the Vermonter, and he cracks a smile only after a forkful of beer-battered haddock beignets.\n\n\u00d2I think it\u00d5s good,\u00d3 he says, like a man enjoying a guilty pleasure.\n\nA SELF-DESCRIBED \u00d2psycho\u00d3 when it comes to details, Mr. Boulud, 54, had planned a Paris-meets-Texas diner before anyone had heard of credit-default swaps. The concept evolved a little, but not the price point. Homemade sausages and hamburgers will be the centerpiece at DBGB, and the average bill for a three-course meal will come to about $32, the price of an appetizer at Daniel, his flagship.\n\nHe brings to this enterprise something like home-field advantage, opening in the city that made him a culinary star. With that comes buzz; nearly every week, news about some element of the layout, design and construction of DBGB pops up on the most trafficked restaurant blogs in Manhattan.\n\nBut by Dinex Group\u00d5s own calculations, DBGB must generate $4.5 million a year in revenue to be profitable, not easy in a time that a spokesman for the National Restaurant Association called \u00d2the most challenging the restaurant industry has seen in several decades.\u00d3 A consumer marketing firm, NPD, issued a report a few weeks back stating that national restaurant traffic had dropped for a second consecutive quarter.\n\n\u00d2And there will be at least one more down quarter, maybe two,\u00d3 says Harry Balzer, an NPD vice president.\n\nIn New York City, it\u00d5s been ugly at nearly all price levels.

{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "LONG before the number was redolent of bailouts and bank failure, David Neff decided that Trillion was the perfect name for his clothing store here on Worth Avenue, this town\u00d5s boulevard of luxe retail.\n\nThe idea was to brace customers for the you\u00d5ve-got-to-be-joking price tags \u00d1 $6,800 for a sport jacket, $800 for a button-down shirt \u00d1 and to convey unparalleled opulence.\n\n\u00d2We wanted people to know that this is a lot,\u00d3 Mr. Neff says, gesturing to the clothing, \u00d2and we didn\u00d5t want anyone to open next door with a store that sounded like it might be more.\u00d3\n\nUntil last year, this idea actually seemed reasonable.\n\nThen the meltdown vaporized the portfolios of multimillionaires here and, soon after, a beloved Wall Street wizard and Palm Beach homeowner named Bernie Madoff was unmasked as a fraud.\n\nFor years, Mr. Madoff\u00d5s elusive genius act beguiled his Jewish neighbors, as well as friends of those neighbors, and so on, and so on, until vast chunks of local money were hoovered into his Ponzi scheme. Life savings, dreams, and countless inheritances, gone.\n\n\u00d2A guy stood right there and cried,\u00d3 says Mr. Neff, pointing at a table covered with $800 cashmere cable knit sweaters. \u00d2And he told me he\u00d5d lost it all, his wife lost it all, his daughter lost it all. He said to me, \u00d4I had everything with Bernie.\u00d5 \u00d3\n\nA lot of regular customers haven\u00d5t been seen in Trillion since Hurricane Madoff struck in December \u00d1 including, of course, the hurricane himself.\n\nThe last time he was here, he fell for a $2,000 pair of worsted spun cashmere pants, which Trillion didn\u00d5t have in his size, and had to be ordered from Italy.\n\nAfter the slacks arrived, but before Mr. Madoff could come by for a fitting, he was arrested.\n\n\u00d2I remember I heard about the arrest and I went directly to the store to charge those pants on his credit card,\u00d3 recalls Mr. Neff, a fit, gray-haired man in perpetual motion. \u00d2But the card had already been canceled.\u00d3\n\nSo, what happened to the pants?\n\n\u00d2They\u00d5re in the racks, over there,\u00d3 Mr. Neff says, nodding toward the trouser section.\n\nWait a minute.\n\nYou have Bernie Madoff\u00d5s unclaimed $2,000 pants, on a rack, in this store?\n\n\u00d2Uh-hmm,\u00d3 he says, with a slightly abashed grin. \u00d2Would you like to see them?\u00d3\n\nNOBODY keeps a statistic called \u00d2fortunes lost per square mile,\u00d3 but let\u00d5s crunch some numbers.\n\nPalm Beach has just 10,200 residents on a land mass that is not quite three times the size of Central Park. It\u00d5s so packed with wealth that the joke here is that calling someone a \u00d2millionaire\u00d3 is an insult.\n\nGiven the density of the superrich, given the roughly 20 percent decline in the value of real estate since the housing bust, and given the concussive impact of Mr. Madoff, Palm Beach might well have this dubious distinction: the net worth of the average resident here has recently plunged, in absolute terms, by more than the average net worth of residents in any other town or city in the country.\n\nOf course, when your $50 million is cut to a third, you\u00d5ve lost a lot of money but you\u00d5re still rich by any sane standard. And real estate agents say they don\u00d5t know of any foreclosures here, which means the place is relatively unscathed, compared with Florida\u00d5s new tumbleweed suburbs.\n\nBut you don\u00d5t often find catastrophic loss in the midst of spectacular plenty. It\u00d5s a bizarre combination, and we\u00d5ve come to see how Palm Beach is handling it. The answer is not very well, though the trauma here is, for the most part, invisible to the naked eye. Public displays of affliction are not Palm Beach\u00d5s style.\n\nTo learn what ails the place, you need to talk to retailers and the rare chatty local. Palm Beach, they will tell you, is reeling and much of it is seething, too. Jews and gentiles here have long lived and socialized in different spheres, with some of the latter quietly irked to find more of the former moving in every year. The Madoff scheme targeted the Jewish populace, as everyone knows, and among Jews there is a galling sense that the gentiles are privately thrilled by the fiasco.\n\nAs paranoid as this might sound, it has a ring of truth to Laurence Leamer, a Palm Beach resident and author of \u00d2Madness Under the Royal Palms,\u00d3 a history of the island."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "We are not going anywhere.\n\nThat is what we learned from a report last week by the Census Bureau which found that fewer Americans are changing residences than at any time since 1962, back when there were 120 million fewer Americans than today.\n\nThe numbers are yet another worrying beep from the array of gizmos that monitor our economic coma. But the report also signals a profound, if barely noticed, change to our national psyche, one that goes far beyond the way we think about housing.\n\nFor decades, Americans have been known as epic consumers, but it would be more accurate to call us epic upgraders. During all those years of packing up and moving, we were headed to a bigger house, at a better address, perhaps for a higher-paying job. We were trading up, and that urge \u00d1 to acquire something bigger or better, preferably something bigger and better \u00d1 is a quintessentially American urge. It is so neatly woven into the double helix of our DNA that we hardly notice it.\n\nWhen we buy a television, it\u00d5s rarely because we lack a TV. We want a thinner TV, or a bigger TV, or a TV with features that sound beguiling even if we have no idea what they do. Like the DynaLight Dynamic Back Light Control on the latest Toshiba high-definition set. What is that? We don\u00d5t know. But we\u00d5ll take two.\n\nOr we would if we could afford them. To fully understand our collective shock over our pulse-less economy, take a good look at the upgrade cycle that we\u00d5ve been gleefully riding for at least three decades. Until last year, if you were living the 2.3 version of Life, you had your eyes on version 2.4 and odds were pretty good that you\u00d5d get it. Maybe on an overextended credit card, or from a loan that you really couldn\u00d5t afford. But you\u00d5d get it.\n\nNow, if you\u00d5re living Life 2.3, your ambition is to avoid Life 2.2.\n\nForget the upgrade. The game now is avoiding the downgrade. This is grim and troubling, in part, because so much of our consumer culture is built around the enticements of the Better.\n\nEntire corporate strategies target the bottomless American appetite for the upgrade. Holders of American Express\u00d5s regular old green card might eventually get an invitation to upgrade to a gold card. (More privileges, more perks! For a fee, of course.) And once you\u00d5ve swiped that baby for a while, you might get an invitation to upgrade to platinum. (Yet more privileges, yet more perks! And higher fees.) If you behave yourself with the platinum card, you could join the purportedly exclusive ranks of black card holders, who pay a one-time initiation fee of $5,000 and then $2,500 annually.\n\nAll of these slabs of plastic do basically the same thing \u00d1 help you acquire stuff \u00d1 but they also confer ever larger increments of cachet on the holder. This allows you to upgrade your material life while signaling, to anyone who can see you in midpurchase, just how upgraded your material life already is.\n\nNo company has exploited America\u00d5s upgrade fever quite as deftly as Apple. The company is one of the very few that has kept most prices at prerecession levels while managing to report profits, as it did last week. Of course, Apple makes wonderful computers, software and gadgets, but is also brilliant at making everything you bought from it nine months ago seem slow, fusty and pass\u008e.\n\nThe compulsion to upgrade is most glaring in cities \u00d1 particularly New York and Los Angeles \u00d1 which are filled with the upwardly mobile who relocate in search of upgraded opportunities surrounded by savvier, richer, trendier people. These transplants are constantly trading up not just their jobs but their group of friends. Everyone in New York and L.A. has had this experience: you make a plan for dinner with a buddy, which he cancels with a lame, last minute excuse (\u00d2I\u00d5m just exhausted\u00d3). What you both know is that he got a late-breaking better offer. He upgraded his dinner.\n\nThe cities themselves are constantly being upgraded; there is scarcely a block in Manhattan that is far from a construction site, or a building that\u00d5s just been knocked down to make way for a bigger, better building. The upgrade-seekers of the city intuitively understand the city\u00d5s own upgrade addiction and are remarkably tolerant of the noise and inconvenience. Contrast that with Paris, a city that radiates a contentment with its present state. You can walk for miles without seeing a crane, hard hat or jackhammer.\n\nIn the United States, upgrade-mania has bred a sense of entitlement, which has only stoked upgrade demands. In recent years, when anything went wrong in any transaction \u00d1 the airline misplaced your luggage, Little Caesars sent you a medium with pepperoni and mushroom and you hate mushrooms \u00d1 you were owed an upgrade. A business class ticket, an order of crazy bread, something.\n\nPerhaps the sense of being owed an extra won\u00d5t go away any time soon.\n\nBut there has long been an on-again, off-again war in the American soul between the forces of consumerism and the countervailing force of austerity. The consumers have had the upper hand for decades, but we might have little choice now but to find comfort in the words of the philosopher and transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau, who wrote, \u00d2Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.\u00d3\n\nObviously, this man didn\u00d5t live in the age of Canon Elph, or the XBox 360 or the Range Rover LR3. But we can\u00d5t afford that cute new, teeny weeny digital camera in the Best Buy insert, so we\u00d5ll have to stick with the now ungainly looking model we bought a year ago. We can\u00d5t afford the Elite Passes and Gold Club memberships that were the open sesame to spiffier rental cars and bigger hotel rooms, so we\u00d5ll have to get used to compact vehicles and the double at the Motel 6.\n\nAnd the house you own? Well, if you can still make the mortgage payments, learn to love it. Because for the time being, it will have to do."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": " If you're driving alone through the plains of Nebraska and need a little company, you can't do better than the nationally syndicated maestros of political talk radio. Hour after hour, rant after rant, it is a feast of words and feverish emotion, interrupted only by regular commercials and the occasional call from the awe-struck fan.\n\nI'd heard these voices before, but only in sound bites. When you don't own a car and don't tune in at home, you probably don't run into Michael Savage, Rush Limbaugh or Mark Levin. On the highways of the Cornhusker State, they ran into me, every time I hit the scan button. After a while, it felt like a series of visits from very colorful and highly agitated relatives. Or it would if I had a lot of relatives certain that America is slouching toward a socialist abyss.\n\nThe apparent influence of these conservative talk professionals has caused more hand-wringing than usual in recent weeks, in the wake of our summer of angry town hall meetings and the ''You lie!'' outburst of Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina. And when you hear Barack Obama likened to Pol Pot -- as Mr. Savage did in a recent show-- you can understand the concern. But to my uninitiated ears, there was something reassuringly familiar about political talk radio, and not because I know a lot about firebrands.\n\nIt's because I listen to a lot of rap. Gangsta rap, in particular.\n\nI'll admit that the parallels between Jay-Z and Rush Limbaugh do not seem obvious, and to grasp them you need to look beyond the violence and misogyny that have made rap a favorite target of the right wing. (Come to think of it, perhaps each of these realms will be chagrined to be likened to the other.) But as soon as you dig beneath the surface, the similarities between talk radio and gangsta rap are nothing short of uncanny. And these similarities are revealing, too.\n\nBut before we get to the revelations, let's examine the kinship. For great careers in both businesses you'll need:\n\nEGO Extolling your greatness is nearly as crucial to rap as it is to talk radio. One consistent theme of Jay-Z's lyrics is the genius of Jay-Z's lyrics. He claims a charisma that is almost mystical and skills on the mic that make him the ''Mike Jordan of recording,'' ''the Bruce Wayne of the game,'' a ''god.''\n\nRush Limbaugh peppers his show with self-adulating incantations that would seem right at home on a Snoop Dogg track, calling himself ''Chief Waga-Waga El Rushbo of the El Conservo Tribe,'' ''doctor of democracy,'' and ''a weapon of mass instruction.'' Both he and Jay-Z have referred to themselves as ''a living legend.''\n\nHATERS You're nobody in hip-hop until you claim to have hordes of detractors. The paradox, of course, is that the artists who regularly denounce their haters have a huge and adoring audience. How does Lil Wayne complain in song about the legions who seek his ruin even as he dominates the charts? Ask Michael Savage, who is forever describing himself as an underdog, marginalized by the media -- on the more than 300 stations that carry his show.\n\nFEUDS50 Cent vs. Ja Rule. Lil' Kim vs. Foxy Brown. Jay-Z vs. Nas. Every couple of years, one rapper will pick a fight with another and battle it out with the winner typically determined by sales. This will sound familiar to anyone who has followed, say, Bill O'Reilly's broadsides at Mr. Limbaugh (''Walk away from these right-wing liars!'' Mr. O'Reilly said of an unnamed rival, described as someone who smokes a cigar and owns a private jet) or Mark Levin's attack on Mr. O'Reilly. (''He has a fledgling radio show, that has no ratings,'' Mr. Levin said in 2008, ''and he'll be off radio soon because he's a failure.'' Levin's predication came true in January of this year.) Liberal ranters can partake, too, as MSNBC host and fulminator par excellence Keith Olbermann has proven with his long running O'Reilly spat. "}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "IN the wee hours of Friday morning, Quentin Tarantino stood in a West Village bar that had opened for him and his entourage \u00d1 cast members of his new movie, \u00d2Inglourious Basterds,\u00d3 and his longtime producers, Bob and Harvey Weinstein. Swinging a blue cocktail in one hand, he held forth about the time that Harvey told him he\u00d5d like to invest in a restaurant.\n\nEli Roth, left, and Brad Pitt in \u00d2Inglourious Basterds,\u00d3 a make-it-or-break-it gambit for the Weinstein Company.\n\nThe goal, Harvey explained to Mr. Tarantino at the time, wasn\u00d5t to schmooze, or to get the best table. New York City had just banned cigarettes from restaurants and Harvey, then an avid smoker, didn\u00d5t approve.\n\n\u00d2He said, \u00d4I want to light up in my own restaurant and blow smoke in the fire marshal\u00d5s face,\u00d5 \u00d3 Mr. Tarantino recalled.\n\nVintage Harvey chutzpah. The story killed, and when the laughing died down, Bob smiled, waited a beat and added another punch line.\n\n\u00d2A million dollars,\u00d3 he sighed, \u00d2for a cigarette.\u00d3\n\nAh, the flush years. They must seem kind of distant now. Because four years after Disney bought the Weinsteins out of Miramax, the company that first ushered indie films into the multiplex, the brothers are under serious stress.\n\nA full accounting of their agita begins, naturally, with a batch of underperforming movies. Since opening its doors in 2005, the Weinstein Company has released about 70 films, and more than one quarter of them failed to break the $1 million box-office mark in the United States. Thirteen of these took in less than $100,000.\n\nTo complicate matters, the company\u00d5s beloved reality television show, \u00d2Project Runway,\u00d3 was until recently sidelined by litigation. Harvey decided last year to move the show from Bravo to Lifetime, prompting NBC, which owns Bravo, to sue, contending that it had the right to match Lifetime\u00d5s bid and keep the program. In April, the Weinstein Company settled for an undisclosed sum, and those backstabbing fashionistas will return to the air, at long last, on Thursday night.\n\nYes, the brothers have had triumphs as well. Bob, who handles the lowbrow genre stuff, scored with the supernatural thriller \u00d21408\u00d3 and \u00d2Scary Movie 4.\u00d3 (These brought in $72 million and $91 million, respectively.) Harvey showed a bit of the maestro\u00d5s touch with \u00d2Hoodwinked,\u00d3 and with \u00d2The Reader,\u00d3 which has taken in $101 million around the world, despite some tepid reviews, and won Kate Winslet an Oscar.\n\nBut the Weinsteins\u00d5 flop-to-jackpot ratio has been high enough to prompt the brothers to hire Miller Buckfire & Company, financial advisers who help troubled clients restructure. Last week, the firm finished its review and is urging Team Weinstein to release and promote only 10 movies a year, unload unpromising titles from its film library and avoid empire-building.\n\nTo shore up their finances, the brothers received a bridge loan a few months ago estimated at $75 million from Ziff Brothers Investments, according to two people familiar with the loan who requested anonymity because they weren\u00d5t authorized to speak publicly about it.\n\n\u00d2We are a private company and aren\u00d5t going to comment on unsubstantiated claims from unnamed sources,\u00d3 Harvey says of the bridge loan. He points over and over to what he describes as a robust pipeline of film, theater and television projects, not to mention a library of 250 films. Sit tight, he advises, and don\u00d5t bet against us.\n\nBut some backers of the Weinstein Company say they\u00d5re getting anxious. They were corralled in 2005 by Goldman Sachs, which helped raise $1 billion for the company. At the time, filmmaking had acquired a certain cachet in private equity circles, and here was a chance to bankroll what were arguably two of the greatest movie producers in modern cinematic history.\n\nStarting in the late \u00d580s, the Weinsteins produced \u00d2Pulp Fiction,\u00d3 \u00d2Shakespeare in Love,\u00d3 \u00d2The English Patient,\u00d3 \u00d2My Left Foot,\u00d3 \u00d2Good Will Hunting,\u00d3 \u00d2The Piano\u00d3 and hundreds of other movies, garnering 249 Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best picture. In one 11-year stretch, they racked up 13 best-picture nominations.\n\nSO what happened? In part, the Weinstein Company is coping with the same problems facing every other studio, most notably the grim slowdown of the DVD market. But plenty of the Weinsteins\u00d5 wounds are also self-inflicted. Instead of using their lush, Goldman-fueled pile of start-up money to focus on filmmaking, the brothers ventured into such new realms as fashion (buying part of Halston, the once-storied label), online social networking (through A Small World, known informally as MySpace for Millionaires) and a piece of Ovation, the cable network.\n\nThese were all Harvey\u00d5s ideas \u00d1 his attempt, he says, at a Barry Diller-style conglomerate. The problem wasn\u00d5t just that the companies failed to generate vast profits. It\u00d5s that they took Harvey\u00d5s eye off the film ball, which is why he kept whiffing.\n\n\u00d2What happened was, I got more fascinated by these other businesses and I figured, \u00d4Making movies, I can do that in my sleep,\u00d5 \u00d3 he says in an interview in his office in downtown Manhattan. \u00d2I kind of delegated the process of production and acquisitions. Yes, I had a say in it, but was I 100 percent concentrating? Absolutely not. I thought I could build the company and delegate authority, and that\u00d5s where it went wrong.\u00d3\n\nBob, meanwhile, has disavowed his goal of becoming the next king of African-American urban comedies, an unlikely ambition for a Jewish guy from Queens. But a few years ago, he took note of Tyler Perry\u00d5s success, and it looked like easy money. Bob produced \u00d2Long Shots,\u00d3 with Ice Cube, and \u00d2Soul Men\u00d3 with Bernie Mac and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\n\u00d2Did like $15 million gross,\u00d3 Bob says of \u00d2Soul Men,\u00d3 \u00d2and it was a relatively expensive, $20 million movie. And for an African-American movie, there\u00d5s no foreign business. So those were two bad missteps, definitely.\u00d3\n\nFor months, the brothers have ignored media requests for comments, leaving lots of \u00d2Are the Weinsteins goners?\u00d3 articles and blog posts with boilerplate denials offered up by their representatives. The two broke their silence to deliver this very simple message: We\u00d5re back to what we know. Bob is planning three new \u00d2Scream\u00d3 films, the most profitable franchise in the Weinsteins\u00d5 history. Harvey has sworn off interest in the nonmovie parts of his business, sounding a bit like a married man lamenting a fling.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5m going to just do this and nothing else,\u00d3 he says."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": " There was a time in this country when a company reporting a few billion in earnings could count its money while basking in polite, reverent applause.\n\nThat time ended Tuesday.\n\nIt was the morning that Goldman Sachs reported net income of $3.44 billion, a number that surprised even analysts who follow investment banking. JPMorgan Chase came two days later with news that it had earned $2.7 billion in the second quarter, even more than it earned in the same period last year, before the economy had a cardiac infarction.\n\nThen on Friday, Citigroup and Bank of America -- two of the great basket cases of the meltdown -- reported outstanding numbers, too.\n\nAll of these companies were beneficiaries of gargantuan government bailouts, in assorted forms and varied sums, but if they assumed they'd hear bravos for prompt paybacks and quick turnarounds, they were in for a shock. At a time when so many people are struggling with foreclosures and are either unemployed or worried about losing a job, these earnings were bound to stir up some basic questions of fairness.\n\nAnd along with those questions, a rebirth, perhaps, of a type of anger that hasn't been widespread for a while: good old class resentment.\n\nIt's making a comeback. As recently as April, President Obama could say at a news conference at a Group of 20 summit meeting, that Americans ''don't resent the rich; they want to be rich,'' without raising eyebrows. Today, the first half of that comment is starting to sound like a stretch. And when it comes to people who earned their fortunes through the financial industry, it seems wrong.\n\nSomething closer to the current zeitgeist was captured last week by Bill O'Reilly, the Fox News commentator, who likened Goldman Sachs bankers to pigs during a scathing segment on his TV show. ''You've got to make an example of the big boy,'' he fumed in a rant about the company's tax-avoidance methods, suggesting Goldman ought to be punished for failing to cough up its fair share of taxes. ''And this is the big boy.''\n\nJon Stewart went the deadpan comedy route on his show this week: ''Goldman Sachs makes $3.4 billion in profit from April to June. I guess the bailouts are working. For Goldman Sachs.''\n\nClass resentment has waxed and waned in this country, but it is not typically a widespread, default emotion of the American middle class. This is at least in part because it's an article of faith here that through some combination of hard work and luck, you might get rich, too. And why abuse, soak or heap scorn upon a group you at least have a theoretical chance of joining?\n\nThe recession -- with its yawning gap between the bonus class on the one hand and the foreclosed upon and newly jobless on the other -- is changing that. It's not merely that Americans have, at least temporarily, abandoned the hope that they'll earn scads of money. It's the widespread sense that winners in this economy are produced by a game that's rigged.\n\nWhich is why the response to last week's earnings bonanza has been a mix of, among other things, bafflement and anger. If these companies can return to the festivities so quickly, were they really having the near-death experience they and the government claimed? And if taxpayers risked their money when they backstopped Wall Street's misadventures, why aren't they sharing in the upside now that the party has started again? And did these companies have the time to rethink the risk culture that landed us in this jam in the first place?\n\nIn private, Wall Street executives have questions of their own.\n\nLike, wait a sec -- isn't returning to profitability exactly what you wanted us to do? And if the nation's circulatory system of money is beginning to flow again, isn't that good news? Oh and by the way, we are paying you back.\n\nIt's telling that from politicians, there's been mostly silence.\n\nNeither Representative Barney Frank nor Senator Chris Dodd -- respectively, the Democrats who lead the House and Senate committees that handle banks -- issued press releases about those earnings last week, according members of their staffs. Neither returned a call for this article."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "In a few weeks, the Treasury Department\u00d5s czar of executive pay will have to answer this $100 million question: Should Andrew J. Hall get his bonus?\n\nMr. Hall, the 58-year-old head of Phibro, a small commodities trading firm in Westport, Conn., is due for a nine-figure payday, his cut of profits from a characteristically aggressive year of bets in the oil market.\n\nThere is little doubt that Mr. Hall is owed the money under his contract. The problem is that his contract is with Citigroup, which was saved with roughly $45 billion in taxpayer aid.\n\nCorporate pay has become a live grenade in the aftermath of the largest series of corporate bailouts in American history. In March, when the American International Group, rescued at vast taxpayer expense, was to give out $165 million in bonuses, Congress moved to constrain the payouts, and protesters showed up at the homes of several executives.\n\nAs it happens, one can see some of those homes from Mr. Hall\u00d5s front lawn in Southport, not far from his office. But his case is more complex. Mr. Hall, raised in Britain and known for titanium nerves and a collection of pricey art, is the standout performer at an operation that has netted Citigroup about $2 billion over the last five years. If Citigroup will not pay him the huge sums he has long made, someone else probably will.\n\nThe added wrinkle is that Mr. Hall works in a corner of the trading world that appears headed for its own infamy. Regulators are pushing to curb the role of traders like Mr. Hall, whose speculation in the energy markets may have played a major role in the recent gyrations of oil prices.\n\nThat suggests that last summer, drivers paid more at the pump, at least in part, because of people like Andrew J. Hall. How do you hand $100 million to a guy who may have profited because gas hit $4 a gallon?\n\nWhatever the answer, the case of Mr. Hall highlights the hazards of mixing the public interest with capitalism at its most unbridled, and it raises basic questions of fairness. There was outrage last week over a report by the New York attorney general that about 5,000 traders and bankers at bailed-out firms got more than $1 million each last year. So it could be politically untenable for a company like Citigroup to pay gargantuan sums even to those who generate gargantuan profits \u00d1 the very people the company must retain if it is to recover.\n\nAmong those who believe the Phibro-Citigroup relationship is doomed by bailout politics is the $100 million man himself. People with knowledge of talks between Phibro and Citigroup say that Mr. Hall is quietly pushing for what is being called \u00d2a quiet divorce\u00d3 from his parent company and that he has had preliminary talks with one possible suitor.\n\nWary of publicity and worried that he will become the next marquee villain of the financial collapse, he has discussed with Citigroup\u00d5s leadership a number of possibilities, including a spinoff.\n\nMr. Hall has plenty of sway over the fate of Phibro because much of its value is thought to flow from his expertise and track record. If he leaves, he could start another firm and bring colleagues with him.\n\nHistory suggests that he is accustomed to getting his way. Two years ago, Mr. Hall waged a legal fight with the Historic District Commission of Fairfield over an 82-foot concrete sculpture that he had placed on the front lawn of his 7,300-square-foot Greek Revival mansion, where he lives with his wife, Christine. He thought he did not need permission to display the work, but because of his neighborhood\u00d5s preservation restrictions, the state Supreme Court ultimately ruled that he did.\n\n\u00d2The strange part is that I think he would been approved if he\u00d5d asked for permission,\u00d3 says Richard Hatch, who headed the commission at the time.\n\nMr. Hall lent this work to the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, though not because he lacks display space. A few years ago, he bought a medieval castle in Germany from the neo-expressionist painter Georg Baselitz, and he and his wife have turned the property, said to contain roughly 150 rooms, into a private museum for their collection.\n\n\u00d2He has about 4,000 pieces in what could easily be described as one of the world\u00d5s finest collections of contemporary art,\u00d3 said a New York dealer, Mary Boone. It includes pieces by Andy Warhol, David Salle, Bruce Nauman and Julian Schnabel.\n\nThe son of a British Airways employee who trained pilots, Mr. Hall was raised near London, and he graduated from Oxford University with a degree in chemistry. He moved to the United States in 1981 to work for British Petroleum. His trading there caught the eye of Phibro, a firm that started as Phillip Brothers early in the last century and which, in the 1970s, was the home of Marc Rich, the fugitive pardoned by President Bill Clinton.\n\nBy 1987, Mr. Hall was running Phibro. It is based today in a generic red building, part of a bucolic, 53-acre office park that was once a dairy farm. (Its former neighbors included the notorious AIG Financial Products division.) The trading floor is a modest room that was once the company\u00d5s kitchen, before it downsized about a decade ago.\n\nMr. Hall and his colleagues \u00d1 there are about 55 in the Westport office, and handfuls in London and Singapore \u00d1 specialize in a variety of hedging and arbitrage techniques.\n\nGenerally, Phibro looks for anomalies in the market and pounces, taking advantage of unusual spreads between the spot price of oil and the price of an oil futures contract."}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "There are 46 days left in 2009, which means it is just about time to commence the beloved and enduring parlor game known as \u00d2Name That Decade.\u00d3\n\nYou know the rules \u00d1 coin a pithy, reductive phrase that somehow encapsulates the multitude of events, trends, triumphs and calamities of the past 10 years. If you can also rope in some of the big personalities and consumer obsessions, that\u00d5s a bonus.\n\nFor the \u00d500s, it seems the trick will be finding a small package sturdy and flexible enough to capture so much upheaval and change. And worry \u00d1 although in hindsight, it sure seems like we kept worrying about the wrong menace.\n\nThe decade began with a frenzy of fear about the Y2k millennium bug, which many technology experts said would sunder computers, crash jets and wreak havoc in every corner of the globe. As that non-emergency passed, a genuine threat quietly gathered in the form of a plot to fell the twin towers.\n\nLater, we scoured Iraq for weapons of mass destruction, which we did not find. As we searched, we built weapons of financial chaos right here at home, with home mortgages, leverage and something called Collateralized Debt Obligations.\n\nFortunes and a staggering number of jobs have vanished, inflicting misery in this country and others on a scale that would surely have exceeded the most garish of Saddam\u00d5s fantasies.\n\nSo: The Era of Misplaced Anxiety?\n\n\u00d2How about the Decade of Disruptions?\u00d3 suggests Walter Isaacson, the former editor of Time magazine and author of a biography of Benjamin Franklin. \u00d2We had coasted through the \u00d590s with irrational exuberance. Between the fall of the Berlin Wall until the fall of the twin towers, there was nothing unnerving us. It was the decade after the cold war and it seemed like we were done with global struggles.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2Then we get to a decade that begins with 9/11 and we realize we will be involved with a global struggle. And the decade has various financial disruptions \u00d1 the dot-com bubble, Enron \u00d1 culminating in the one last year. It\u00d5s been a decade as bumpy as the \u00d590s were blithe.\u00d3\n\nThe upside of \u00d2disruption\u00d3 is that it\u00d5s flexible enough to capture both the financial meltdown and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But what if you just want to focus on our money woes?\n\n\u00d2This will be remembered as the era when the North went South,\u00d3 offers Carmen Reinhart, economist and co-author of \u00d2This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.\u00d3\n\nBy North and South Ms. Reinhart isn\u00d5t referring to geography; she means developed economies and emerging economies.\n\n\u00d2If you look at the 1990s, it was a decade of emerging market crises,\u00d3 she said. \u00d2The big peso blowout in Mexico in 1994 and \u00d595. Asia erupts in the summer of \u00d597 and the Asian crisis runs into \u00d598.\u00d3 And so on.\n\n\u00d2Meanwhile, the North was in its Great Moderation phase,\u00d3 Ms. Reinhart said. \u00d2If you look at academic discussion and even public perception, in the first seven years of this decade, people thought the North had beaten the business cycle. Not only did we convincingly show that we have not mastered the business cycle, but we\u00d5re having an emerging-market style of crisis. This is something we haven\u00d5t seen in the postwar era and it\u00d5s something that in the years of the Great Moderation we would have thought unthinkable.\u00d3\n\nActually, the Decade of the Unthinkable is pretty good, too. If nothing else pleasant can be said about the last 10 years, they sure weren\u00d5t dull.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s been a tough decade for those of us in the future prediction business,\u00d3 says the futurist Paul Saffo, who teaches at Stanford University. \u00d2Realities have consistently outpaced our wildest imaginings.\u00d3\n\nMr. Saffo said he had struggled to keep his forecasts a few paces ahead of the times, which appears to be the inspiration for his decade appellation of choice.\n\n\u00d2Overshoot,\u00d3 he says. \u00d2It\u00d5s been a decade of overshoot.\u00d3\n\nOvershoot?\n\n\u00d2In the \u00d590s,\u00d3 he says, \u00d2we had all the indicators of the problems that were coming and in our complacency we did nothing.

{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "After her sport utility vehicle sideswiped a van in early February, Shirley Kimel was amazed at how quickly a handful of police officers and firefighters in Winter Haven, Fla., showed up. But a real shock came a week later, when a letter arrived from the city billing her $316 for the cost of responding to the accident.\n\nA couple of months after being in a car accident, Shirley Kimel received bills in the mail for the response of firemen and police. Her insurance company advised her not to pay, and so she has not paid the bills.\n\n\u00d2I remember thinking, \u00d4What the heck is this?\u00d5 \u00d3 says Ms. Kimel, 67, an office manager at a furniture store. \u00d2I always thought this sort of thing was covered by my taxes.\u00d3\n\nIt used to be. But last July, Winter Haven became one of a few dozen cities in the country to start charging \u00d2accident response fees.\u00d3 The idea is to shift the expense of tending to and cleaning up crashes directly to at-fault drivers. Either they, or their insurers, are expected to pay.\n\nSuch cash-per-crash ordinances tend to infuriate motorists, and they often generate bad press, but a lot of cities are finding them hard to resist. With the economy flailing and budgets strained, state and local governments are being creative about ways to raise money. And the go-to idea is to invent a fee \u00d1 or simply raise one.\n\nOhio\u00d5s governor has proposed a budget with more than 150 new or increased fees, including a fivefold increase in the cost to renew a livestock license, as well as larger sums to register a car, order a birth certificate or dump trash in a landfill. Other fees take aim at landlords, cigarette sellers and hospitals, to name a few.\n\nWisconsin\u00d5s governor, James E. Doyle, has proposed a charge on slaughterhouses that would be levied on the basis of each animal slaughtered. He also wants to more than triple the application charge for an elk-hunting license to $10, an idea that has raised eyebrows because the elk population in the state is currently too small to allow an actual hunting season.\n\nWashington\u00d5s mayor, Adrian M. Fenty, has proposed a \u00d2streetlight user fee\u00d3 of $4.25 a month, to be added to electric bills, that would cover the cost of operating and maintaining the city\u00d5s streetlights. New York City recently expanded its anti-idling law to include anyone parked near a school who leaves the engine running for more than a minute. Doing that will cost you $100.\n\n\u00d2The most dangerous places on Staten Island are the schools at drop-off and dismissal time, when parents are parked three deep in the road,\u00d3 says James S. Oddo, a City Council member from Staten Island who voted for the measure. \u00d2There is a mentality here that Johnny can\u00d5t walk 100 feet, he has to be dropped off right at the front of the school \u00d1 and frankly that\u00d5s why Johnny is as pudgy as he is.\u00d3\n\nNothing, it seems, is off the table. In Pima County, Ariz., the County Board of Supervisors increased an assortment of fees, including the cost of AIDS testing. Florida has proposed raising medical visit co-payments for inmates in state prisons. Parking fees at the Honolulu Zoo could rise by 500 percent if a proposal there goes through.\n\nPoliticians tend to regard fees as more palatable than taxes, and more focused too. If a state needs to finance an infrastructure to oversee fishing, why shouldn\u00d5t fishermen foot the bill? But groups like the nonpartisan Tax Foundation in Washington worry that governments are now using fees to shore up budget shortfalls rather than cover specific costs incurred by specific users.\n\n\u00d2When it comes to paying for bananas, you\u00d5ve got the market as a mechanism to make sure you\u00d5re paying a fair price,\u00d3 says Josh Barro, a staff economist at the Tax Foundation. \u00d2But when it comes to getting your driver\u00d5s license renewed, the government has a monopoly, and you have no idea what it costs the state or what it\u00d5s doing with the money.\u00d3\n\nIn some cases, towns say they are merely enforcing rules that have long been on the books. For the first time in years, for instance, officials at Londonderry, N.H., have mailed notices to dog owners reminding them to renew their annual dog licenses, which cost $6.50 apiece, or face a $25 fine. Town leaders think the get-tough approach could raise an additional $20,000, but Meg Seymour, the town clerk, is dreading local reaction. When the town last sent out fine notices, in 2002, the calls to her office were vicious.\n\n\u00d2Let\u00d5s just say that we\u00d5re the ones who take the venting,\u00d3 she said. \u00d2You have no idea.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "david_segal", "text": "It\u00d5s unlikely that any group of professionals is happier to highlight the dullness of their work than small-town bankers.\n\nAt a recent conference held here by the Indiana Bankers Association, attendees said it over and over: our business is plodding and boring and we would not have it any other way.\n\n\u00d2Banking should not be exciting,\u00d3 said Clay W. Ewing, president of retail financial services at German American Bancorp, a community bank in Jasper. \u00d2If banking gets exciting, there is something wrong with it.\u00d3\n\nIt is an ethos squarely at odds with the risk-addicted style of megabanks, like Citigroup and Bank of America, that trafficked in the subprime mortgages and complex financial products that helped drive the country into the grimmest recession in decades.\n\nBut to the deep chagrin of Mr. Ewing and others at the conference, the public, politicians and the media have made little distinction between the stress-tested behemoths and the 7,630 community banks across the country \u00d1 the vast majority of which have watched the crisis like bystanders at a 10-car pileup.\n\nAs a result, community bankers have felt compelled in recent months to mount public relations campaigns to emphasize their fiscal health and in some cases to announce they rejected Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, funds. Some have held cookouts, others have held \u00d2reassurance\u00d3 meetings in their lobbies, hoping to educate customers and prevent panics. All are dealing with banker jokes and the occasional wisecrack.\n\n\u00d2I was on vacation in California and this guy I had just met said, \u00d4So, traveling on that bailout money, huh?\u00d5 \u00d3 said Blake Heid, of First Option Bank in Paola, Kan., which didn\u00d5t take any bailout money. \u00d2I didn\u00d5t find that very amusing.\u00d3\n\nThough they greatly outnumber the national and regional banks, community banks have barely registered in any of the fallout from the credit crisis, in part because they hold less than 10 percent of the $13.8 trillion in bank assets nationwide.\n\nThe 50 or so bank failures have been largely clustered in a few states, like Florida, Arizona and California, where the bursting housing bubble had the greatest impact.\n\nIn states like Indiana, where property values never soared, community banks have been rock solid. The last failure in the state was in 1992.\n\nTo spend time with these Indiana community bankers is to step into an alternate universe, where everything sounds a little strange because it makes perfect sense. You hear things like, \u00d2If you don\u00d5t understand the risk you\u00d5re taking, don\u00d5t take it.\u00d3 And, \u00d2We want to be around for decades, so we\u00d5re not focused on the next quarter.\u00d3\n\nForget \u00d2too big to fail.\u00d3 These banks consider themselves too small to risk embarrassment. They are run by people who grew up in the towns where they work, and their main fear is getting into a financial jam that will shame them in the eyes of their neighbors.\n\nThe steep profits earned by national banks didn\u00d5t turn their heads in the last decade because they were inherently skeptical of double-digit growth rates.\n\n\u00d2We like a nice, gentle, upward slope,\u00d3 said Donald E. Goetz, the president of DeMotte State Bank, an 11-branch operation in the northwest part of Indiana.\n\n\u00d2This kind of growth, like you see in the stock market\u00d3 \u00d1 Mr. Goetz ran his hand through the air, tracing the shape of a mountain range \u00d1 \u00d2that doesn\u00d5t interest us.\u00d3\n\nOne recent morning Mr. Goetz gave a tour of his bank, which included a bulletin board with fliers for a fire department fish fry and the Kankakee Valley Women\u00d5s Club flower sale.\n\nThere is a lot of bric-a-brac in his wood-paneled office and a Thomas Kinkade painting of a green-gabled stone house after a snow fall, titled the \u00d2Olde Porterfield Gift Shoppe.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2There is one set of footprints, going in,\u00d3 he said, pointing to the painting. \u00d2That\u00d5s how we feel as a business sometime. We\u00d5re walking alone.\u00d3\n\nMr. Goetz, who was wearing a tie and a short-sleeve shirt, started as a teller at DeMotte right after he graduated from college in 1976, and he\u00d5s been president since 1988. He is a stolid guy who, when asked what he does for fun, offered two words: \u00d2Yard work.\u00d3\n\nHe sounds somewhat aggrieved. His bank, which opened in 1917, didn\u00d5t make any subprime loans, nor did it take any bailout money. Even when bank stocks were soaring, not one of his 246 shareholders needled him to earn more than the 3 to 4 percent dividend that DeMotte has generated for years.\n\nStill, he\u00d5s had to train employees in the art of assuaging the fears of jittery customers. He programmed the blinking signs outside his branches to read \u00d2Safe, Strong, Secure.\u00d3\n\nDespite these efforts, he\u00d5s fielded some customer calls at night, to his home. In rare cases, people withdrew their savings.\n\n\u00d2We had three or four people panic,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2A couple of them said, \u00d4It\u00d5s not the bank. We just don\u00d5t trust the government.\u00d5 And I told them, \u00d4If the government fails, the money you\u00d5re taking out of this bank won\u00d5t be worth anything.\u00d5  \u00d3\n\nMr. Goetz, like a lot of his competitors, is livid about the mortgage shenanigans born of the securitization craze. But he thinks his public relations problem had many authors.\n\n\u00d2The media, Congress, the president, everyone just keeps saying \u00d4the banks, the banks, the banks,\u00d5 like we\u00d5re all the same thing,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2Well, we\u00d5re not all the same thing.\u00d3\n\nExplaining that distinction has been especially challenging for community banks that signed up for TARP funds, which initially were pitched by the government as a way to shore up healthy banks. Only later, after the American International Group bonus fiasco, community bankers say, did the TARP acquire a stigma.\n\n\u00d2We heard a lot of smart-alecky comments,\u00d3 said James C. Latta, president of the Idaho Banking Company in Boise, Idaho, which took $6.9 million in TARP funds. \u00d2A lot of \u00d4Wish I had a bailout.\u00d5 \u00d3\n\nAt DeMotte, Mr. Goetz is bracing for a steep increase in a crucial overhead cost: the bill from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is basically an insurance fund underwritten by banks.\n\nLast year, DeMotte paid $42,000 into the fund. This year, because of failures in other parts of the country and particularly among national banks, that sum will rise to $500,000 or more.\n\n\u00d2Isn\u00d5t that the American way?\u00d3 he says, folding his arms. \u00d2Whoever is left standing, whoever was prudent, is always the one who has to pick up the pieces.\u00d3"}

There are Cheerios and peanut-butter crackers, and a minifridge filled with take-out boxes. Above the microwave hangs a picture of a man walking in clouds.\n\nClifford Joseph, 39, shares an apartment in Brooklyn with the youngest two of his five children. After some hard times and personal mistakes, Mr. Joseph thinks the best is still ahead for them.\n\n\u00d2Help me believe in what I could be, and all that I am,\u00d3 the framed text reads. \u00d2Teach me to take one day at a time.\u00d3\n\nWith five children and monthly expenses that dwarf his paycheck, Clifford L. Joseph has turned to that motto each day for inspiration.\n\nHe has come a long way from the recklessness of his 20s and the nomadic hop, from apartment to apartment and job to job, that consumed his 30s.\n\nNow, Mr. Joseph, 39, a clerical associate at the Department of Environmental Protection who earns about $650 a week, hopes to get a better job and earn enough to leave behind the worries of feeding his family.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5m getting a slow start,\u00d3 Mr. Joseph said. \u00d2I\u00d5m assuming the best is yet to come.\u00d3\n\nRaised by foster parents in Rochester, N.Y., he felt a void left by his biological parents and struggled to focus on his studies.\n\nHe became frustrated as he saw his social circle get caught up in drugs and violent behavior. His own behavior teetered on the rambunctious. At 19, he had his first child, and over the next two years, he had two more.\n\nThe pressures of young parenting, coupled with persistent misgivings about his identity, were overwhelming. He decided to act, asking a friend who worked at a hospital to search a database for Doreatha Covington, his biological mother.\n\nWithin minutes, he had her phone number, and the next day, the two met. At their reunion, she introduced him to the rest of the family. She died a few months later, after years of drug abuse, but he remains in touch with other family members.\n\nSeeking a fresh start, Mr. Joseph moved to New York City in 1996. The burdens of raising young children (he shares custody with the two mothers of his children) and a fractured romantic life impeded his progress. He took temporary jobs and moved several times as he sought to shield his children from drugs and violence.\n\nIn 2006, finding himself on the brink of homelessness, he moved back to Rochester while he looked for permanent work in New York City. Two violations on his record (one for unpaid parking tickets in 2005; the other for disorderly conduct in 2004) stalled his search. \u00d2It was depressing; it was hard,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2I hate starting over.\u00d3\n\nHe suffered another setback in 2006, when unpaid utility bills led to his electricity being shut off, and he had to boil water to keep warm. This resulted in an outbreak of mold that ruined about $1,200 worth of clothes, books, toys and a mattress.\n\nLater that year, Mr. Joseph turned to the Community Service Society, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and received $1,800 for a new futon and one month\u00d5s rent on a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn.\n\n\u00d2It took some of the stress off,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2It helped me live a quieter life.\u00d3\n\nIn early 2007, he found the job at the Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nHis children \u00d1 Porche, 19; Quandell, 18; Kiara, 17; Tyler, 11; and Asia, 10 \u00d1 appreciated the stability. The two who still live with him, Tyler and Asia, have excelled in school.\n\nBut the influx of monthly bills \u00d1 $700 for rent, $240 for MetroCards, $100 for his phone \u00d1 still far exceeds Mr. Joseph\u00d5s ability to pay. He hopes that by passing a real estate exam and marketing his acting skills on the side (he has performed in several community plays), he will be able to find a job that will pay for a bigger apartment with a real kitchen.\n\n\u00d2You just have to be thankful for certain things,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2You think of other people who have worse situations.

He gripped the street pay phone and spoke of his knack for spreading concrete, his expertise in carpentry, his love for painting. He paced and fidgeted, picking at his jagged, mud-encrusted fingernails, and then slammed down the receiver in triumph.\n\nWednesday morning at Ditmas and Coney Island Avenues in Brooklyn, about 50 men gathered in groups near the Dunkin\u00d5 Donuts and the Three Star Food Market. After about three hours, the shape-up for day laborers was over. A dozen or so had a job, and the rest went home, to return the next day.\n\nOn this day, unlike the week before or that day in March when the bosses tricked him into working without pay, he would make money.\n\nBy 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday, the street pageant of day laborers had begun. Dozens of burly men in dusty Timberlands joined Mr. Perez on the four corners at Ditmas and Coney Island Avenues in Brooklyn. They rolled up their sleeves and tightened their belts, hoping that a flash of brawn would bring passing construction vans to a halt. The less robust among them whipped out immigration papers, some on the verge of disintegration, praying that on this day, their legal status might give them an edge.\n\nTo watch the shape-up of day laborers at one New York City intersection is to glimpse desperation, entrepreneurship and clannishness take form and then dissolve in three hours \u00d1 three turns of the clock in the corner Dunkin\u00d5 Donuts, 180 jumps of the minute hand on their scratched-up Casio wristwatches.\n\nBy 9:30 or 10, the construction vans were gone and only a dozen or so of the nearly 50 who had gathered actually got work. The unsuccessful began their tired walks back home, but they knew that the odds would still get them out of bed the next morning.\n\nFrom the start, prospects on Wednesday looked dim. Traffic was light. The sun gave a hint of the afternoon\u00d5s heat. They stared as each car passed a construction supply shop across the street, waiting to jump at the screech of brakes.\n\nMr. Perez, a 22-year-old Honduran immigrant, sat alone in the shade, using his work clothes as a cushion.\n\nThat morning, at the recommendation of a friend, he had called a construction company to make his pitch and arrange for the pickup.\n\nWithin the group of day laborers that formed on this day, Mr. Perez\u00d5s success bred quiet jealousy. On his corner, men from Guatemala, Ecuador, and Mexico stood at a distance, chatting about the outrageous joke on the radio the day before, the good-looking girl in the supermarket, and how hard it was to get jobs.\n\nMr. Perez, electrified by the $85 in sight for 10 hours of work, was optimistic. A single man with skin darkened by his days in the sun, he said he looked forward to coming to the corner each day.\n\n\u00d2For me, this is a good life,\u00d3 he said in Spanish. \u00d2If I knew English, I would have a better job, but this isn\u00d5t bad at all.\u00d3 At 6:45, the black construction van came and whisked him away.\n\nThe remaining men arranged themselves by region, Latin Americans in one spot, Pakistanis in another, Nepalese and Tibetans in their own huddle. Down the block from Mr. Perez, the group of Pakistani men began their morning ritual of smoking and snacking. They puffed cigarettes and picked berries from the mulberry trees, licking each morsel on their purple-stained hands. This was breakfast. \u00d2Eat,\u00d3 they told each other. \u00d2Eat!\u00d3\n\nStanding at a distance was the group\u00d5s reclusive, white-whiskered elder. They called him Beardman, and he tried to wave down vans with his hitchhiker\u00d5s thumb. In the middle of the gathering stood Jacky Sing, a homeless man who seemed hopeful of getting a job, but in the meantime drank a Budweiser and showed off his overgrown toenails.\n\nThe eight Pakistani men talked about the hard life in America \u00d1 how everything was fine until this year, when the construction jobs began to vanish. Mohammad Ejaz, 58, said he was getting about half the number of jobs he did last year. Zahid Shad, 41, said he had worked four days in the past two months.\n\nTariq Bukhari, 45, said he came to this country five years ago looking for a way to support his five children back home.\n\n\u00d2People have a dream that America has big money,\u00d3 Mr. Bukhari said. \u00d2You shake a tree and money falls. That\u00d5s a big dream. It\u00d5s not true.\u00d3\n\nAcross the street, 19-year-old Lucas Puac waited with three other Guatemalans hoping that youth and flexibility would make them stand out. Mr. Puac, an illegal immigrant, said he had built a reputation with several contractors and typically worked four or five days a week, usually painting or helping spread concrete. But he said he felt abused by the low wages, which amounted to $600 to $1,000 a month."}

They will now be screened before their departure. If a test reveals a probable or positive case of swine flu, the courts will be informed, Mr. Morello said, adding that any inmate with the virus will be isolated at Rikers.\n\nThe Kross Center houses nearly 2,600 inmates.\n\nCitywide, 240 people are ill with the flu, and 56 have been hospitalized, according to the city\u00d5s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene."}

But come this fall, she, like many low-income tenants in rent-stabilized homes, is likely to be hit with a higher-than-expected increase.\n\nThe city\u00d5s Rent Guidelines Board, which regulates rent for New York City\u00d5s one million rent-stabilized apartments, approved the highest rent increases in years on Thursday. The board authorized increases of up to 4.5 percent on one-year leases and 8.5 percent on two-year leases.\n\nThe board also took the unusual step of authorizing a supplemental rent increase that affected only tenants who have lived in their apartments for six years or more.\n\nOwners of buildings with those tenants have the option of charging them the approved increases or a $45 monthly increase for one-year leases or $85 for two-year leases, whichever is greater. Ms. Soto, who has been in her apartment for 12 years, could face either increase.\n\nDozens of tenants and tenant advocates who gathered on the steps of City Hall on Sunday morning to protest the increases, saying they unfairly affect seniors and working families. Landlords acknowledged that the increases would be difficult for some renters, but said that they were needed to make up for rising operating costs.\n\nFor some tenants, the increases, which will apply to leases renewed between Oct. 1, 2008, and Sept. 30, 2009, will mean cutting back on groceries and gas. Others said they might be forced to move out.\n\nMs. Soto, 54, and her husband, 77, both immigrants from the Dominican Republic, receive about $1,200 per month from Social Security. Her husband is retired, and she is unable to work because of back problems and numb hands.\n\nThey already have difficulty paying the rent for their two-bedroom apartment.

Manuela Ceballos, a single mother who has lived in her Inwood apartment for 17 years and pays $1,200 each month, said her budget, too, is already strained. She wondered how she would provide for her three children and pay for her 17-year-old son to go to college in the fall.\n\n\u00d2How am I going to survive? How am I going to pay?\u00d3 said Ms. Ceballos, a parent coordinator at school.\n\nAnother Inwood resident, Albania Lopez, said she had canceled her planned summer vacation to the Poconos and worried whether she would be able to continue to pay for English and math tutoring for her two daughters.

The supplemental increase was not part of a range of increases approved in May, and a memorandum describing it was distributed to board members on Thursday morning.\n\nCity Councilman Miguel Martinez, a Manhattan Democrat, said advocates were seeking ways to help evicted tenants find aid through city programs, and were considering challenging the Rent Guidelines Board\u00d5s handling of the increases.\n\nTenants said they hoped the new fees would somehow fall through.

The recovery was driven by increases in production and declining inventories \u00d1 for example, assembly-line workers turning stockpiles of iron and steel into cars.\n\nManufacturing executives heralded the numbers as an indication that this engine of the economy was in \u00d2sustainable recovery mode.\u00d3 But some economists urged caution, noting the government\u00d5s role in stimulating manufacturing through its cash-for-clunkers program, which offered thousands of dollars in credits toward the purchase of new vehicles.\n\nAnd the number of new orders, an indicator of how busy factories will be in the months ahead, declined slightly, adding to concern that the revival of the manufacturing sector may be slow.\n\nThere were also indications on Monday of growth in the housing industry.\n\nA report from the National Association of Realtors showed that the number of existing-home sales increased for the eighth month in a row in September. But part of that increase was attributed to a popular government tax credit for first-time home buyers, which is expected to expire in November. And economists noted that foreclosures would continue to inundate the market and drive up total inventory.\n\n\u00d2We\u00d5re finally seeing some natural momentum begin to take place in the housing market,\u00d3 said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. \u00d2It is absolutely essential to strengthen the housing sector to get this economy and the banks up and running again.\u00d3\n\nThe construction of new buildings appeared to be on the rise. The Commerce Department said on Monday that spending on new construction had climbed by the largest amount in a year, reaching $940.3 billion.

In addition, UBS in Switzerland reported another quarter of losses, sending European stocks tumbling.\n\nIn the afternoon, automakers including General Motors and Fordreported sales in October had risen by small amounts, while Chrysler's sales had declined 30 percent.

Are we going to have to have more stimulus for some of the banks that we have over here?'' Mr. Faretta said.\n\nAdding some optimism, the Commerce Department said Tuesday that orders to United States factories had climbed by 0.9 percent in September, the fifth increase in six months. The data indicated that consumers were hungry for goods of all types, including cars, cigarettes and clothing. The numbers were better than analysts had expected.\n\nInvestors also reacted to news that Warren E. Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway would buy Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad for $26 billion. Mr. Buffett called his purchase ''an all-in wager on the economic future of the United States,'' and his investment signaled confidence in transportation and the future of consumer demand.\n\nBurlington Northern's stock climbed 27.5 percent to $97, and other railroad stocks surged.\n\nDespite optimistic earnings reports from major companies in recent weeks, executives are still relying on cost-cutting as they seek to drive up profits.

Smith Sr., who turned ordering a hamburger by speaking into a microphone from a parked car into a national habit, died last Monday in Oklahoma City, Okla. He was 87.\n\nHis death was announced by the Sonic Corporation, the nationwide chain of drive-in restaurants he founded in 1959.\n\nAs a young man fresh out of the United States military, Mr. Smith turned somebody else\u00d5s trifle of an idea into an enterprise. One day, while driving along the Texas-Louisiana border, he grew giddy at the sight of a fast-food joint with a car-to-kitchen intercom. He asked the owners for a replica of the audio system, and he soon made it the centerpiece of his root beer stand in Shawnee, Okla.\n\nFamilies, delighted by both the efficiency and absurdity of using a tiny microphone to command milkshakes to the driver\u00d5s seat, flocked to the Sonic drive-ins. By the late 1970s, Mr. Smith was operating one of the most successful fast-food chains in the United States; from 1977 to 1978, he broke ground on an average of one location a day, mostly concentrated in the South. Today, the company operates nearly 3,600 locations in 42 states. Bob Blackburn, executive director of the Oklahoma Historical Society and the author of \u00d2Sonic: The History of America\u00d5s Drive-in\u00d3 (Cottonwood Publications, 2009), said Mr. Smith\u00d5s business model flourished because it came just as Americans began to embrace car culture and recreational eating.\n\n\u00d2He came up with a formula that restaurants are a people business,\u00d3 Mr. Blackburn said. \u00d2He defined what it means to be an entrepreneur.\u00d3\n\nTroy Nuel Smith Sr. was born in Seminole, Okla., on May 26, 1922. He grew up in the oil patches of east central Oklahoma and in 1943 joined the Army Air Forces. When the war ended, he began work as a milk truck driver.\n\nMr. Smith found that he did not like to be ordered around, and he decided to leave trucking to become his own boss. He turned his entrepreneurial spirit toward food, opening several restaurants in Shawnee, including a diner called the Cottage Caf\u008e and an upscale steak house known as the Log House Restaurant.\n\nBut it was the Top Hat, a root beer stand that he opened in 1953, that became Mr. Smith\u00d5s most lucrative endeavor, consistently yielding a 20 percent profit. He abandoned the other businesses, hoping to capitalize on the growing popularity of drive-in restaurants.\n\nIn the 1950s, drive-ins were already a staple of the American fast-food scene. Mr. Smith sought to reinvent them. He added an intercom system that made it possible to deliver food within three minutes; wired each restaurant with speakers to pipe in radio hits; added angular parking to increase privacy; and maintained a fleet of roller-skating carhops, even as other restaurants were cutting back. He came up with a slogan \u00d1 \u00d2Service with the Speed of Sound\u00d3 \u00d1 and trademarked the Sonic name in 1959.\n\nMr. Smith used the franchise model to attract young talent and develop workers into managers. In the early 1980s, however, the bleak economy and concerns about quality forced him to close 300 of his 1,300 restaurants.\n\nMr. Smith stayed involved in Sonic for most of his life, even though he retired from managing day-to-day operations in 1983; he kept a seat on the board.\n\nMr. Smith is survived by his wife, Dollie; a daughter, Leslie Baugh; a son, Troy Smith Jr., known as Butch; eight grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.\n\nIn his business interactions, he was known for chuckling in the face of bad news and greeting colleagues with effusive praise. In September, when he could not appear at a company convention because of his health, he taped a message for company employees, apologizing for not thanking them enough over the years."}

But government programs to encourage consumer spending on things like cars and houses are expiring, and employers remain reluctant to hire more workers, suggesting the recovery may not last, economists say.\n\n\u00d2The big-picture perspective is that things have improved,\u00d3 said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. \u00d2The question is, how sustainable is this growth going forward?\u00d3\n\nFor most people, the recovery will not feel real until jobs are more plentiful and the housing market improves. Jobs may still be hard to find well into 2010, economists say. A government report to be released next week is expected to show that unemployment rose again this month.\n\nStill, Wall Street welcomed the news of renewed economic growth, with major stock indexes ending the day about 2 percent higher. The Dow Jones industrial average soared 200 points, to close at 9,962.58.\n\nBefore the third quarter, the gross domestic product \u00d1 the government\u00d5s broadest measure of total goods and services produced \u00d1 had been shrinking for a year. It bottomed out with a 6.4 percent rate of decline in the first three months of this year, the steepest fall since 1982.\n\nThe trend was halted last quarter primarily because of consumers, who drove most of the economic gains.\n\nThe government\u00d5s cash-for-clunkers program spurred consumers to spend more on durable goods, orders of which grew at an annual rate of 22.3 percent in the third quarter after a decline in the previous quarter. Similarly, the $8,000 federal tax credit for first-time home buyers helped revive housing sales, which rose at an annual rate of 23.4 percent in the third quarter. Housing sales had actually fallen by a comparable amount in the previous three months.\n\nThe $787 billion stimulus package, which was passed last winter and is still being distributed, is also credited with strengthening economic activity, although the precise contribution is contested.\n\nMany economists worry that the effects of these government initiatives will be short-lived and that the next few quarters may show sluggish growth or even a second dip.\n\nThe Obama administration has argued that even temporary government programs may make families feel more comfortable with spending and business more comfortable with making bigger investments for the longer term.\n\nStill, withering consumer confidence and concerns about a weak recovery have left companies wary of hiring more employees. The jobless rate reached 9.8 percent in September, its highest in 26 years.\n\nInitial jobless claims fell by 1,000 in the latest week, to 530,000, according to a Labor Department report also released on Thursday. The number has been heading down but is still well above the levels historically associated with job creation, according to John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.\n\nConcerns about rising unemployment may pressure the administration to look for additional ways to stimulate the economy. Proposals include another extension in unemployment benefits and various job creation programs.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s all in the hopper,\u00d3 said Christina D. Romer, chairwoman of the president\u00d5s Council of Economic Advisers. \u00d2It would be irresponsible if we weren\u00d5t thinking about these kinds of programs.\u00d3\n\nBusinesses are drawing down their inventories more slowly, possibly because they anticipate more demand in the future, economists said. The businesses have largely sold out their current stock, Thursday\u00d5s report showed. This means they will increase orders in the coming months to replenish supplies.\n\n\u00d2Everybody had been dealing with a just-in-time status quo,\u00d3 said Sandra Westlund-Deenihan, president and design engineer for Quality Float Works, a company in Schaumburg, Ill., that makes valve assemblies. She said companies might be growing tired of building new products as orders rolled in one by one, and are now ready to have stock back on the shelves again.\n\nLike many American manufacturers, Ms. Westlund-Deenihan says that international business has helped keep her company afloat. The country\u00d5s overall exports grew at an annual rate of 14.7 percent, and imports at 16.4 percent, in the latest quarter.\n\nWhile these numbers mean the United States\u00d5 trade gap has widened, they also provide hope that the global economy may finally be recovering from a collapse in activity earlier this year.\n\n\u00d2When the economy gets fully back on track in the latter half of next year, the recovery is likely to be stronger than the recovery following the 2001 recession, when exports were anemic due to an overvalued dollar and weak growth abroad,\u00d3 said David Huether, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.\n\nThe official end of the recession will be determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Its business cycle dating committee looks at output as well as other indicators like employment to make that call. The group spent a year examining data before declaring that the recession had begun in December 2007.\n\nSome economists say they expect the panel will eventually decide that the recovery began sometime this summer.\n\nThe third-quarter economic growth came without a major surge in inflation.\n\nThe price index for gross domestic purchases, a measure of prices that United States residents pay for goods and services, increased at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with a small increase in the second.\n\nExcluding food and energy prices, the inflation index rose 0.5 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 0.8 percent in the second."}

Bloomberg\u00d5s education reform efforts. Over the past seven years, the city has closed more than two dozen large comprehensive high schools, which typically enroll thousands of students, and replaced them with smaller schools, which are supposed to foster more intimate relationships and higher student achievement.\n\nThe report, conducted by researchers at the New School\u00d5s Center for New York City Affairs, does not dispute the success of small schools in improving graduation rates of needy students. But it argues that the city should do more to support comprehensive high schools, which have been saddled with large numbers of the high-needs students who do not enroll at small schools.\n\nThe 18-month study examined 34 large high schools and found that 14 of them had decreases in attendance and graduation rates from 2003 to 2008, when the number of small schools in the city multiplied.\n\nBased on interviews with principals, teachers and parents, the report concluded that the reason for the decreases was that the comprehensive high schools were overwhelmed by influxes of students who had histories of poor attendance, behavior problems and low academic achievement. Many of those students came from closed failing schools that were replaced with small schools, the report said.\n\n\u00d2Small schools have really made remarkable gains for thousands of kids, but there\u00d5s a price, and the price is a lot of the large schools have gotten worse,\u00d3 said Clara Hemphill, an author of the New School report, who is known for her guidebooks on the city\u00d5s best public schools.\n\nThe city\u00d5s Department of Education disputed several of the report\u00d5s findings, saying decreases in graduation and attendance rates at large high schools could not be linked to the creation of small schools.\n\nMelody Meyer, a spokeswoman for the department, noted that demographic changes alone could account for an influx of 15,000 high school students from 2002 to 2005, and that graduation rates had improved citywide over the past seven years.\n\nIn an interview with the researchers, Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein defended his small-schools strategy, saying that even if schools were burdened with high-risk students, it was better than leaving those students in failing schools.\n\n\u00d2There were some growth pains,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2The process is not over.\u00d3\n\nStephen M. Duch, principal of Hillcrest High School in Queens, which serves 3,200 students, said that his school had instituted small learning environments \u00d1 with themes like pre-med, theater and health careers \u00d1 partially in response to an infusion of higher-needs students after the opening of small schools in the area.\n\n\u00d2Given the deflection of students, it was even more paramount to change the way we ran the school,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2You bring over 3,000 kids into a building of 200 teachers, and it can be very anonymous. Students could fall through the cracks.\u00d3\n\nOne point of agreement between the city and the researchers was the looming challenge posed by a state mandate to impose more rigorous graduation standards, which affects this year\u00d5s ninth graders. The report noted that a disproportionately high number of students at small high schools might have difficulty satisfying requirements for the more rigorous state Regents diplomas that will soon be required.\n\nThe City Council\u00d5s Education Committee is expected to discuss the new graduation requirements on Thursday.\n\nThe report expressed caution about the future of small schools, which boast an average class size of 27, compared with 34 citywide. It found high rates of principal and teacher turnover at the schools, and said that attendance and graduation rates had declined each year at many of the schools that opened since 2002, though they still outperformed the schools they replaced.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s partly that they burn very hot and fast,\u00d3 Ms. Hemphill said. \u00d2They start out with a huge level of enthusiasm among teachers and staff, but it\u00d5s really, really hard work, and after a certain number of years of 80-hour workweeks, the teachers get tired.\u00d3\n\nCritics of small schools have argued that much of their success can be attributed to the fact that they serve populations markedly different from the failing schools they replace. The New School report, however, indicated that while disparities had existed in the past, most small schools matched citywide averages in the number of students who were from low-income families, were in special education programs or were struggling with English."}

New home construction slowed unexpectedly in October, the government reported.\n\nA separate report showed that consumer prices inched upward in October, but not enough to make inflation a concern even with the dollar weakening and interest rates at record lows.\n\nThe data on home construction showed a decline in the rate of single- and multiple-family home building, contributing to an overall decrease of 10.6 percent in housing starts from September. In total, construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529,000 housing units in October, falling short of the 600,000 predicted by analysts. Building permits, an indicator of future construction, declined as well, to an annual rate of 552,000, from 575,000, also falling short of forecasts.\n\nApartment construction slowed to a record low, dipping to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 53,000 in October. Analysts attributed the decrease to the reluctance of banks to finance large construction projects and lackluster demand for rentals as vacancies remained abundant.\n\nPart of the overall decline in housing construction might be explained by the uncertainty in October over whether Congress would extend a tax credit for first-time home buyers. This month, lawmakers voted to extend the credit through April, but builders might have been reluctant to begin construction in October without assurance that homes would be bought.\n\nThe revival of the housing market is considered crucial to reviving the economy. Construction adds jobs to the economy, and once a home is sold, consumers typically go on spending sprees as they fill it with appliances and furniture.\n\n\u00d2These figures can be pretty volatile from month to month, so it may just be a blip,\u00d3 Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note on Wednesday. \u00d2Nevertheless, taken at face value it suggests home builders are still uncertain about the sustainability of the rebound in home sales.\u00d3\n\nCelia Chen, senior director at Moody\u00d5s Economy.com, said demand for homes would probably remain weak into 2010.\n\n\u00d2The housing market is still very fragile,\u00d3 she said. \u00d2It seems that the market has bottomed in terms of sales and starts, but that stability can be easily broken, even if affordability is very high.\u00d3\n\nThe Labor Department\u00d5s report on consumer prices showed that the Consumer Price Index climbed 0.3 percent, above analysts\u00d5 estimates of 0.2 percent. The index measures the changes in the cost of a bundle of goods for consumers \u00d1 things like cooking oil, airplane tickets and medical care.\n\nThe increases came because of rising energy and motor vehicle costs, the report said. When the government excluded the cost of food and energy, which can be volatile, prices rose 0.2 percent.\n\nThe prices of cars and trucks showed steep increases. Analysts said that could be a side effect of the government\u00d5s popular cash-for-clunkers program, which depleted the supply of both cheaper 2009 models and used vehicles, driving up prices.\n\nThe small increase in consumer prices signaled that inflationary pressures, by and large, appear to be in check, restrained by the nation\u00d5s high unemployment rate and significant unused factory capacity. On Tuesday, a report on wholesale prices showed similar results, though there were signs that higher prices might be on the horizon.\n\n\u00d2Effectively, this gives the Federal Reserve a checkered flag to keep rates exceptionally low for an extended period of time,\u00d3 said Brian Bethune, chief United States financial economist for IHS Global Insight."}

Geithner said he considered a robust dollar an important part of an economic recovery.\n\n\u00d2I believe deeply that it\u00d5s very important to the United States, to the economic health of the United States, that we maintain a strong dollar,\u00d3 Mr. Geithner said, according to news reports.\n\nSome analysts, however, believe that behind closed doors, policy makers in Washington are happy to see a slow and steady depreciation of the dollar. The weak dollar makes American products cheaper overseas, buoying sales, and makes imports more expensive, encouraging consumers at home to buy American.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Richard W. Fisher, seemed to hint at that view, saying the drop in the dollar\u00d5s value had not been \u00d2disorderly\u00d3 and that rates were likely to remain low for an extended period, Reuters reported.\n\n\u00d2Sentiment is still negative, and the comments of the Federal Reserve have only fanned the flames,\u00d3 said Marc Chandler, the global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.\n\nAs the dollar fell, gold reached $1,117.40 an ounce at the stock market\u00d5s close on Wednesday, setting another record high as hedge fund managers and wealthy speculators continued to buy the precious metal.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average ended trading up 44.29 points, or 0.43 percent, at 10,291.26. The broader Standard and Poor\u00d5s 500-stock index rose 5.50 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,098.51, and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 15.82 points, or 0.74 percent, to 2,166.90. Crude oil settled at $79.28 a barrel, up 23 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThe zeal from strong trading days in Europe and Asia seemed to help perk up Wall Street. The FTSE 100 in Britain closed 0.69 percent higher, the DAX in Germany climbed by 0.98 percent and the CAC 40 in France increased by 0.76 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose by 1.61 percent, while the Nikkei in Japan was flat.\n\nA report from China showed the country\u00d5s industrial output and retail sales grew 16 percent from a year earlier, giving investors hope that the global economy was on track for recovery.\n\nAs the market continues to rise, many investors have seemed content to ignore signs that consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the United States economy, might not grow at a rapid pace, given the country\u00d5s high level of unemployment.\n\n\u00d2The consumer is still not spending well,\u00d3 Mr. Neale said. \u00d2Until there\u00d5s some sign of strength in the jobless market and housing market, then the consumer will remain on the sidelines.\u00d3"}
{"klass": "javier_c_hernandez", "text": "Wholesale prices in the United States increased only slightly in October, the Labor Department said Tuesday, easing concerns that inflation might soon emerge as a threat to the economic recovery in a period of extraordinarily low interest rates.\n\nA separate report on industrial production showed weaknesses in the manufacturing sector, which is grappling with tepid consumer demand. The stock markets, meanwhile, rose slightly. Higher oil prices lifted energy stocks, and trading volume remained light.\n\nDavid M. Darst, chief investment strategist for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, said investors took the mixed signals on the economic data in stride.\n\n\u00d2It\u00d5s a two-steps-forward, one-step-back type of environment,\u00d3 he said. \u00d2Many people have worried inflation will snap back with a vengeance, but there still seems to be so much global overcapacity that in the short term we can focus on the play at hand.\u00d3\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.46, or 0.3 percent, to 10,437.42. The broader Standard & Poor\u00d5s 500-stock index gained 1.02, or 0.1 percent, to 1,110.32, while the Nasdaq rose 5.93, or 0.3 percent, to 2,203.78.\n\nThe Labor Department\u00d5s wholesale prices report said that higher food and energy costs contributed to a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent rise in the producer price index, which measures the cost of goods to companies. That fell short of the 0.5 percent jump economists had forecast.\n\nThe index factors in the cost of items like gasoline, food and construction materials to businesses. It is often considered a leading indicator of consumer inflation because it monitors changes in prices before products reach store shelves.\n\nThe data showed a 1.6 percent increase in energy prices in October, driven by higher prices for gasoline and electricity. Food prices, particularly fresh and dried vegetables, also increased 1.6 percent.\n\nExcluding food and energy costs, which tend to be volatile, the price of goods to businesses fell 0.6 percent in October.\n\nInflation has been a chief concern of policy makers as the government tries to revive the economy by keeping interest rates extremely low and pumping billions of dollars into the economy. At the same time, the dollar has fallen to 15-month lows, stoking fears about inflation arising from higher prices for imports.\n\nEven as the Labor Department\u00d5s numbers suggested inflation was under control, some economists said that was only because high unemployment and unused factory capacity had kept inflationary pressures in check.\n\nWhile the price of finished goods remained steady, Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak, said that the price of crude goods, those in the earliest stages of production, increased in an indication that some inflation might be in the pipeline.\n\n\u00d2There is little doubt that over the last few months, inflation has picked up in the economy,\u00d3 Mr. Greenhaus said. \u00d2But we\u00d5re nowhere near concerns about a crazy outbreak.\u00d3\n\nMany analysts say they expect the Fed to keep interest rates low for much of next year. A report on the state of manufacturing released Tuesday by the Fed said industrial production rose 0.1 percent in October, falling short of the 0.4 increase projected by Wall Street analysts. Manufacturing output fell 0.1 percent, the first decline in four months.\n\nIn September, industrial production increased 0.6 percent.\n\nGold climbed $2.10 to $1,141.30. The Treasury\u00d5s 10-year note rose 3/32, to 100 14/32. The yield fell to 3.32 percent from 3.33 percent late Monday."}
